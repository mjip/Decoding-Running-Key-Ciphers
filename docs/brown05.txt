The importance of this 5 can largely be explained by the natural mathematical properties of the middle number and its special relationship to all the rest of the numbers -- quite apart from any numerological considerations , which is to say , any symbolic meaning arbitrarily assigned to it .
Indeed , mathematically speaking , it was both functionally and symbolically the most important number in the entire diagram .
If one takes the middle number , 5 , and multiplies it by 3 ( the base number of the magic square of three ) , the result is 15 , which is also the constant sum of all the rows , columns , and two main diagonals .
Then , if the middle number is activated to its greatest potential in terms of this square , through multiplying it by the highest number , 9 ( which is the square of the base number ) , the result is 45 ; ;
and the latter is the total sum of all the numbers in the square , by which all the other numbers are overshadowed and in which they may be said to be absorbed .
Furthermore , the middle number of the Lo Shu is not only the physical mean between every opposing pair of the other numbers , by reason of its central position ; ;
it is also their mathematical mean , since it is equal to half the sum of every opposing pair , all of which equal 10 .
In fact , the neat balance of these pairs , and their subtle equilibrium , would have had special meaning in the minds of the Old Chinese .
For they considered the odd numbers as male and the even ones as female , equating the two groups with the Yang and Yin principles in Nature ; ;
and in this square , the respective pairs made up of large and small odd ( Yang ) numbers , and those composed of large and small even ( Yin ) numbers , were all equal to each other .
Thus all differences were leveled , and all contrasts erased , in a realm of no distinction , and the harmonious balance of the Lo Shu square could effectively symbolize the world in balanced harmony around a powerful central axis .
The tremendous emphasis on the 5 in the Lo Shu square -- for purely mathematical reasons -- and the fact that this number so neatly symbolized the heart and center of the universe , could well explain why the Old Chinese seem to have so revered the number 5 , and why they put so much stress on the concept of Centrality .
These twin tendencies seem to have reached their height in the Han dynasty .
The existing reverence for Centrality must have been still further stimulated toward the close of the second century B.C. , when the Han Emperor Wu Ti ordered the dynastic color changed to yellow -- which symbolized the Center among the traditional Five Directions -- and took 5 as the dynastic number , believing that he would thus place himself , his imperial family , and the nation under the most auspicious influences .
His immediate motive for doing this may not have been directly inspired by the Lo Shu , but this measure must inevitably have increased the existing beliefs in the latter's efficacy .
After this time , inscriptions on the Han bronze mirrors , as well as other writings , emphasized the desirability of keeping one's self at the center of the universe , where cosmic forces were strongest .
Later , we shall see what happened when an emperor took this idea too literally .
All this emphasis on Centrality and on the number 5 as a symbolic expression of the Center , which seems to have begun as far back as 400 B.C. , also may conceivably have led to the development of the Five-Elements School and the subsequent efforts to fit everything into numerical categories of five .
We find , for example , such groupings as the Five Ancient Rulers , the Five Sacred Mountains , the Five Directions ( with Center ) , the Five Metals , Five Colors , Five Tastes , Five Odors , Five Musical Notes , Five Bodily Functions , Five Viscera , and many others .
This trend has often been ascribed to the cult of the Five Elements itself , as though they had served as the base for all the rest ; ;
but why did the Old Chinese postulate five elements , when the Ancient Near East -- which may have initiated the idea that natural elements exerted influence in human life and activities -- recognized only four ? ?
And why did the Chinese suddenly begin to talk about the Five Directions , when the animals they used as symbols of the directions designated only the usual four ? ?
Obviously , something suddenly caused them to start thinking in terms of fives , and that may have been the workings of the Lo Shu .
This whole tendency had an unfortunate effect on Chinese thinking .
Whereas the primary meanings of the Lo Shu diagram seemed to have been based on its inner mathematical properties -- and we shall see that even its secondary meanings rested on some mathematical bases -- the urgent desire to place everything into categories of fives led to other groupings based on other numbers , until an exaggerated emphasis on mere numerology pervaded Chinese thought .
Scholars made numbered sets of as many things as possible in Nature , or assigned arbitrary numbers to individual things , in a fashion that seems to the modern scientific mind as downright nonsensical , and philosophical ideas based upon all this tended to stifle speculative thought in China for many centuries .
3 .
Yin and Yang in the `` Lo Shu '' square
Although the primary mathematical properties of the middle number at the center of the Lo Shu , and the interrelation of all the other numbers to it , might seem enough to account for the deep fascination which the Lo Shu held for the Old Chinese philosophers , this was actually only a beginning of wonders .
For the Lo Shu square was a remarkably complete compendium of most of the chief religious and philosophical ideas of its time .
As such , one cannot fully understand the thought of the pre-Han and Han periods without knowing the meanings inherent in the Lo Shu ; ;
but , conversely , one cannot begin to understand the Lo Shu without knowing something about the world view of the Old Chinese , which they felt they saw expressed in it .
The Chinese world view during the Han dynasty , when the Lo Shu seems to have been at the height of its popularity , was based in large part on the teachings of the Yin-Yang and Five-Elements School , which was traditionally founded by Tsou Yen .
According to this doctrine , the universe was ruled by Heaven , T'ien -- as a natural force , or in the personification of a Supreme Sky-god -- governing all things by means of a process called the Tao , which can be roughly interpreted as `` the Order of the Universe '' or `` the Universal Way '' .
Heaven , acting through the Tao , expressed itself by means of the workings of two basic principles , the Yin and the Yang .
The Yang , or male principle , was the source of light , heat , and dynamic vitality , associated with the Sun ; ;
while the Yin , or female principle , flourished in darkness , cold , and quiet inactivity , and was associated with the Moon .
Together these two principles influenced all things , and in varying combinations they were present in everything .
We have already seen that odd numbers were considered as being Yang , while the even numbers were Yin , so that the eight outer numbers of the Lo Shu represented these two principles in balanced equilibrium around the axial center .
During the Han dynasty , another Yin-Yang conception was applied to the Lo Shu , considering the latter as a plan of Ancient China .
Instead of linking the nine numbers of this diagram with the traditional Nine Provinces , as was usually done , this equated the odd , Yang numbers with mountains ( firm and resistant , hence Yang ) and the even numbers with rivers ( sinuous and yielding , hence Yin ) ; ;
taking the former from the Five Sacred Mountains of the Han period and the latter from the principal river systems of Old China .
Thus the middle number , 5 , represented Sung-Shan in Honan , Central China ; ;
the 3 , T'ai-Shan in Shantung , East China ; ;
the 7 , Hwa-Shan in Shensi , West China ; ;
the 1 , Heng-Shan in Hopei , North China ( or the mountain with the same name in neighboring Shansi ) ; ;
and the 9 , Huo-Shan in Anhwei , which was then the South Sacred Mountain .
For the rivers , the 4 represented the Huai , to the ( then ) Southeast ; ;
the 2 , the San Kiang ( three rivers ) in the ( then ) Southwest ; ;
the 8 , the Chi in the Northeast ; ;
and the 6 , the ( upper ) Yellow River in the Northwest .
Note that by Western standards this plan was `` upside down '' , as it put North at the bottom and South at the top , with the other directions correspondingly altered ; ;
but in this respect it was merely following the accepted Chinese convention for all maps .
The same arrangement was used when the Lo Shu was equated with the Nine Provinces ; ;
and whenever the Lo Shu involved directional symbolism , it was oriented in this same fashion .
Few persons who join the Church are insincere .
They earnestly desire to do the will of God .
When they fall by the wayside and fail to achieve Christian stature , it is an indictment of the Church .
These fatalities are dramatic evidence of `` halfway evangelism '' , a failure to follow through .
A program of Lay Visitation Evangelism can end in dismal defeat with half the new members drifting away unless practical plans and strenuous efforts are made to keep them in the active fellowship .
The work of Lay Visitation Evangelism is not completed when all of the persons on the Responsibility List have been interviewed .
In the average situation about one-third of those visited make commitments to Christ and the Church .
The pastor and the Membership Preparation and Assimilation Committee must follow through immediately with a carefully planned program .
The first thirty to sixty days after individuals make their decision will determine their interest and participation in the life of the Church .
Neglect means spiritual paralysis or death .
Preparation for membership
churches that have a carefully planned program of membership preparation and assimilation often keep 85 to 90 per cent of their new members loyal and active .
This is the answer to the problem of `` membership delinquency '' .
It is important that persons desiring to unite with the Church be prepared for this experience so that it may be meaningful and spiritually significant .
It is unfair and unchristian to ask a person to take the sacred vows of Church membership before he has been carefully instructed concerning their implications .
Preparation for Church membership begins immediately after the commitment is received .
1 )
The pastor writes a personal letter to each individual , expressing his joy over the decision , assuring him of a pastoral call at the earliest convenient time , and outlining the plan for membership preparation classes and Membership Sunday .
Some pastors write a letter the same night the decision is reported by the visitors .
It should not be postponed later than the next day .
A helpful leaflet may be enclosed in the letter .
2 )
The pastor calls in the home of each individual or family for a spiritual guidance conference .
If possible , he should make an appointment in order that all persons involved may be present .
This is not a social call .
It is definitely a `` spiritual guidance conference '' .
He will discuss the significance of Christian commitment , the necessity of family religion and private devotions , and the importance of the membership preparation sessions .
There may be problems of conduct or questions of belief which will require his counsel .
Each conference should be concluded naturally with prayer .
A piece of devotional material , such as The Upper Room , may be left in each home .
3 )
A minimum of four sessions of preparation for membership is necessary for adults .
Some churches require more .
None should ask less .
Those who join the Church need to be instructed in the faith and the meaning of Christian discipleship before they take the sacred vows .
They will have a greater appreciation for the Church and a deeper devotion to it if membership requires something of them .
Many churches find the Sunday school hour to be the most practical time for adult preparation classes .
Others meet on Sunday night , at the mid-week service , or for a series of four nights .
Some pastors have two sessions in one evening , with a refreshment period between .
The sessions should cover four major areas : A
-- The Christian Faith ; ;
B
-- History of the Church ; ;
C
-- Duties of Church Membership ; ;
D
-- The Local Church and Its Program
.
Following each instruction period a piece of literature dealing with the topic should be handed each one for further reading during the week .
This procedure is much more effective than giving out a membership packet .
Fourth session important
most pastors find that the fourth session should take at least two hours and therefore hold it on a week night prior to Reception Sunday .
In this session the persons seeking membership are provided information concerning the work of the denomination as well as the program and activities of the local church .
The lay leadership of the church may be invited to speak on the various phases of church life , service opportunities , the church school , missions , men's work , women's work , youth program , social activities , and finances .
The budget of the church may be presented and pledges solicited at this session .
An `` interest finder '' or `` talent sheet '' may be filled out by each person .
( See sample on pp. 78-79 .
) The fourth session may be concluded with a tour of the church facilities and refreshments .
The social time gives an opportunity for church leaders to become acquainted with the new members .
Additional suggestions for membership preparation
in conducting the Membership Preparation-Inquirers' Class , the pastor should plan a variety of teaching techniques in order to develop greater interest on the part of the class .
The following have been found effective .
1 )
Extend the number of classes .
Some churches have six or more training sessions of two hours each , generally held on Sunday night or during the week .
This gives greater opportunity for the learning process .
2 )
Use dramatization -- for example , in discussing the Lord's Supper or church symbolism .
3 )
Use audio-visual aids .
Some excellent filmstrips with recordings and motion pictures may be secured from your denominational headquarters to enrich the class session .
4 )
Have a `` Question Box '' .
Some new members will hesitate to ask questions audibly .
Urge them to write out their questions for the box .
5 )
Use a textbook with assigned readings each week .
6 )
Select class members for reports on various phases of the study .
7 )
Conduct examinations , using a true-false check sheet .
8 )
Ask each member to write a statement on such topics as : `` What Christ Means To Me '' , `` What The Church Means To Me '' , `` Why Join The Church '' , `` The Duties Of Church Members '' , etc. .
9 )
Assign a series of catechism questions to be memorized .
10 )
Invite class members to share in an extra period of Bible study each week .
11 )
Ask each new member to bring his Pledge of Loyalty to the Reception Service .
What about transfers ? ?
There is A growing conviction among pastors and Church leaders that all those who come into the fellowship of the Church need preparatory training , including those coming by transfer of membership .
George E. Sweazey writes : `` There is danger in trying to make admission to the Church so easy and painless that people will scarcely know that anything has happened '' .
People appreciate experiences that demand something of them .
Those who transfer their membership are no exception to the rule .
For most of them , it will be their first experience in membership training , since this is a recent development in many churches .
Those coming from other denominations will welcome the opportunity to become informed .
The preparatory class is an introductory face-to-face group in which new members become acquainted with one another .
It provides a natural transition into the life of the local church and its organizations .
Reception into the Church Fellowship
the total process of evangelism reaches the crescendo when the group of new members stands before the congregation to declare publicly their faith and to be received into the fellowship of the Church .
This should be a high moment in their lives , a never-to-be-forgotten experience .
They should sense the tremendous significance of joining the spiritual succession reaching back to Christ our Lord and forward to an eternal fellowship with the saints of the ages .
Every detail of the service merits careful attention -- the hymns , the sermon , the ritual , the right hand of fellowship , the introduction to the congregation , the welcome of the congregation .
This is a vital part of their spiritual growth and assimilation .
It will help to determine the attitude of the new members toward the Church .
It can mean the difference between participation and inaction , spiritual growth and decay .
The worship service is the natural and logical time to receive new members into the Church .
The atmosphere for this momentous experience can be created most effectively through the worship experience .
Psychologically the reception should be the climax , following the sermon .
1 )
Ask the new members to meet thirty minutes before the service to complete `` talent sheets '' and pledge cards .
Some denominations ask new members to sign personally the chronological membership register .
Provide a name card for each new member .
Outline plans for the entire service .
2 )
Arrange a reserved section in the sanctuary where all new members may sit together .
Sponsors may sit with them also .
3 )
Invite sponsors or Fellowship Friends to stand back of the new members in the reception service .
4 )
Give each new member a certificate of membership .
5 )
Introduce each new member to the congregation , asking him to face the congregation .
6 )
Lead the congregation in a response of welcome .
7 )
Have a reception for new members in the parlor or social hall immediately after the service .
8 )
Take a picture of the group of new members to be put in the church paper or placed on the bulletin board .
9 )
Have a fellowship luncheon or dinner with new members as guests .
Chapter 6 planning for the assimilation and growth of new members
the church is `` the family of God '' .
The members of the `` family '' are drawn together by a common love for Christ and a sincere devotion to His Kingdom .
Every member of the family must have a vital place in its life .
This is no spectator-type experience ; ;
everyone is to be a participant .
Yet the most difficult problem in the Church's program of evangelism is right at this point -- helping new members to become participating , growing parts of the fellowship .
Very easily they may be neglected and eventually join the ranks of the unconcerned and inactive .
A study of major denominational membership statistics over a twenty-year period revealed the appalling fact that nearly 40 per cent of those who joined the Church were lost to the Church within seven years .
One denomination had a membership of 1,419,833 at the beginning of the period under study , and twenty years later its membership stood at 1,541,991 -- a net growth of only 122,158 .
Yet during the same period there were 1,080,062 additions .
Another major church body had 4,499,608 members and twenty years later its membership stood at 4,622,444 .
During this time 4,122,354 new members were brought into the fellowship .
Still another denomination had 7,360,187 members twenty years ago .
During this period 7,484,268 members were received , yet the net membership now is only 9,910,741 .
These figures indicate that we are losing almost as many as we are receiving into membership .
This problem is illustrated by the fact that many local churches drop from the active membership rolls each year as many as they receive into the fellowship .
Studies of membership trends , even in some areas where population is expanding , show that numbers of churches have had little net increase , though many new members were received .
Something is wrong when these things happen .
The local `` family of God '' has failed its new members through neglect and unconcern for their spiritual welfare .
Basic needs
new members can become participating , growing members .
But this will not happen merely through the natural process of social life .
It must be planned and carefully developed .
The entire membership of the local church must be alerted to their part in this dynamic process .
If the church has followed the plan of cultivation of prospects and carried through a program of membership preparation as outlined earlier in this book , the process of assimilation and growth will be well under way .
Those who enter the front door of the church intelligently and with Christian dedication will not so easily step through the back door because of lost interest .
However , it is not enough to bring persons to Christian commitment and train them in the meaning of Christian discipleship .
When they unite with the Church they must find in this fellowship the satisfaction of their basic spiritual needs or they will never mature into effective Christians .
The Church expects certain things of those who become members .
The new members justifiably expect some things from their church family :
-- Welcome into the fellowship
-- Sincere Christian love and understanding
-- Inspiring and challenging worship experiences
-- Social and recreational activities
-- Opportunities for Christian service
-- Opportunities for study of the Christian faith and the Bible
-- Creative prayer experiences
-- Guidance in Christian social concerns .
Men need unity and they need God .
Care must be taken neither to confuse unity with uniformity nor God with our parochial ideas about him , but with these two qualifications , the statement stands .
The statement also points to a classic paradox : The more men turn toward God , who is not only in himself the paradigm of all unity but also the only ground on which human unity can ultimately be established , the more men splinter into groups and set themselves apart from one another .
To be reminded of this we need only glance at the world map and note the extent to which religious divisions have compounded political ones , with a resultant fragmentation of the human race .
Massacres attending the partition of India and the establishment of the State of Israel are simply recent grim evidences of the hostility such divisions can engender .
The words of Cardinal Newman come forcibly to mind : `` Oh how we hate one another for the love of God '' ! !
The source of this paradox is not difficult to identify .
It lies in institutions .
Institutions require structure , form , and definition , and these in turn entail differentiation and exclusion .
A completely amorphous institution would be a contradiction in terms ; ;
to escape this fate , it must rule some things out .
For every criterion which defines what something is , at the same time proclaims -- implicitly if not openly -- what that something is not .
Some persons are so sensitive to this truth as to propose that we do away with institutions altogether ; ;
in the present context this amounts to the advice that while being religious may have a certain justification , we ought to dispense with churches .
The suggestion is naive .
Man is at once a gregarious animal and a form-creating being .
Having once committed himself to an ideal which he considers worthwhile , he inevitably creates forms for its expression and institutions for its continuance .
To propose that men be religious without having religious institutions is like proposing that they be learned without having schools .
Both eventualities are possible logically , but practically they are impossible .
As much as men intrinsically need the unity that is grounded in God , they instrumentally require the institutions that will direct their steps toward him .
Yet the fact remains that such institutions do set men at odds with their fellows .
Is there any way out of the predicament ? ?
The only way that I can see is through communication .
Interfaith communication need not be regarded as an unfortunate burden visited upon us by the necessity of maintaining diplomatic relations with our adversaries .
Approached creatively , it is a high art .
It is the art of relating the finite to the infinite , of doing our best to insure that the particularistic requirements of religious institutions will not thwart God's intent of unity among men more than is minimally necessary .
In a certain sense , interfaith communication parallels diplomatic communication among the nation-states .
What are the pertinent facts affecting such communication at the present juncture of history ? ?
I shall touch on three areas : personal , national , and theological .
1 )
By personal factors I mean those rooted in personality structure .
Some interfaith tensions are not occasioned by theological differences at all , but by the need of men to have persons they can blame , distrust , denounce , and even hate .
Such needs may rise to pathological proportions .
Modern psychology has shown that paralleling `` the authoritarian personality '' is `` the bigoted personality '' in which insecurity , inferiority , suspicion , and distrust combine to provide a target for antagonism so indispensable that it will be manufactured if it does not exist naturally .
Fortunately the number of pathological bigots appears to be quite small , but it would be a mistake to think that more than a matter of degree separates them from the rest of us .
To some extent the personal inadequacies that prejudices attempt to compensate for are to be found in all of us .
Interfaith conflicts which spring from psychological deficiencies are the most unfortunate of all , for they have no redeeming features whatsoever .
It is difficult to say what can be done about them except that we must learn to recognize when it is they , rather than pretexts for them , that are causing the trouble , and do everything possible to nurture the healthy personalities that will prevent the development of such deficiencies .
2 )
While the personality factors that aggravate interfaith conflict may be perennial , nationalism is more variable .
The specific instance I have in mind is the Afro-Asian version which has gained prominence only in this second half of the twentieth century .
Emerging from the two centuries of colonial domination , the Afro-Asian world is aflame with a nationalism that has undone empires .
No less than twenty-two nations have already achieved independence since World War 2 , , and the number is growing by the year .
As an obvious consequence , obstacles to genuine interfaith communication have grown more formidable in one important area : relations between Christians and non-Christians in these lands .
Colonialism alone would have been able to make these difficulties serious , for Christianity is so closely tied to colonialism in the minds of these people that repudiation of the one has tended automatically toward the repudiation of the other .
Actually , however , this turns out to be only part of the picture .
Nationalism has abetted not only the repudiation of foreign religions but the revival of native ones , some of which had been lying in slumber for centuries .
The truth is that any revival of traditional and indigenous religion will serve to promote that sense of identity and Volksgeist which these young nations very much need .
Insofar as these nations claim to incarnate traditions and ways of life which constitute ultimate , trans-political justifications for their existence , such people are inevitably led to emphasize the ways in which these traditions and ways are theirs rather than someone else's .
All this works severely against the kind of cross-cultural communication for which Christian missions stand .
Africans and Asians tend to consider not only missions but the local churches they have produced as centers and agents of Western culture and ideology if not of direct political propaganda .
The people hardest hit by this suspicion are , of course , Christians on the mainland of China .
But the problem extends elsewhere .
For example , in Burma and Ceylon many Buddhists argue that Buddhism ought to be the official state religion .
In 1960 Ceylon nationalized its sectarian -- preponderantly Christian -- schools , to the rejoicing of most of its 7,000,000 Buddhists and the lament of its 800,000 Roman Catholics .
Again , India has imposed formidable barriers against the entrance of additional missionaries , and fanatical Hindu parties are expected to seek further action against Christians once the influence making for tolerance due to Nehru and his followers is gone .
The progressive closing of Afro-Asian ears to the Christian message is epitomized in a conversation I had three years ago while flying from Jerusalem to Cairo .
I was seated next to the director of the Seventh Day Adventists' world radio program .
He said that on his tour the preceding year a considerable number of hours would have been available to him on Japanese radio networks , but that he had then lacked the funds to contract for them .
After returning to the United States and raising the money , he discovered on getting back to Japan that the hours were no longer available .
It was not that they had been contracted for during the interval ; ;
they simply could no longer be purchased for missionary purposes .
It is not unfair to add on the other side that the crude and almost vitriolic approach of certain fundamentalist sects toward the cultures and religions among which they work has contributed measurably to this heightening of anti-Christian sentiment .
Ironically , these are the groups which have doubled or tripled their missionary efforts since World War 2 , , while the more established denominations are barely maintaining pre-war staffs .
Although I have emphasized the barriers which an aroused nationalism has raised against relations between Christians and non-Christians in Asia , the fact is that this development has also widened the gulf between certain Afro-Asian religions themselves .
The partition of India has hardly improved relations between Hindus and Muslims ; ;
neither has the establishment of the State of Israel fostered harmony between Muslims and Jews .
3 )
I turn finally to several theological developments .
1 .
Theocracy reconsidered .
The modern world has been marked by progressive disaffection with claims to divine sanction for the state , whatever its political form .
The American Constitution was historic at this point in providing that `` Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof '' .
One of our foremost jurists , David Dudley Field , has gone so far as to call this provision `` the greatest achievement ever made in the course of human history '' .
The trend throughout the world's religions has been toward a recognition of at least the practical validity of this constitutional enactment .
Pakistan was created in 1947 expressly as a Muslim state , but when the army took over eleven years later it did so on a wave of mass impatience which was directed in part against the inability of political and religious leaders to think their way through to the meaning of Islam for the modern political situation .
`` What is the point '' , Charles Adams reports the Pakistanis as asking , `` in demanding an Islamic state and society if no one , not even the doctors of the sacred law themselves , can say clearly and succinctly what the nature of such a state and society is '' ? ?
The current regime of President Mohammad Ayub Khan is determinedly secular .
And while the nation was formerly named `` The Islamic Republic of Pakistan '' , it is now simply `` The Republic of Pakistan '' .
Comparable trends can be noted elsewhere .
The new regime in Turkey is intentionally less Muslim than its predecessor .
The religious parties in Israel have experienced a great loss of prestige in recent months .
During the years when Israel was passing from crisis to crisis -- the Sinai campaign , the infusion of multitudes of penniless immigrants -- it was felt that the purpose of national unity could be best served if the secular majority were to yield to the religious parties .
Now that Israel enjoys relative prosperity and a reduction of tensions , the secularists are less disposed to compromise .
And in this country Gustave Weigel's delineation of the line between the sacral and secular orders during the last presidential campaign served to provide a most impressive Roman Catholic defense of the practical autonomy of both church and state .
The failure at that time of the Puerto Rican bishops to control the votes of their people added a ring of good sense to Father Weigel's theological argument .
Everywhere there seems to be a growing recognition of the fact that governments and religious institutions alike are too fallible and corruptible -- in a word , too human -- to warrant any claim of maintaining partnership with the divine .
2 .
Salvation reconsidered .
My father went as a missionary to China in a generation that responded to Student Volunteer Movement speakers who held watches in their hands and announced to the students in their audiences how many Chinese souls were going to hell each second because these students were not over there saving them .
That mention of this should bring smiles to our lips today is as clear an indication as we could wish of the extent to which attitudes have changed .
I do not mean to imply that Christians have adopted the liberal assumption , so prevalent in Hinduism , that all religions are merely different paths to the same summit .
Leslie Newbiggin reflects the dominant position within the World Council of Churches when he says , `` We must claim absoluteness and finality for Christ and His finished work , but that very claim forbids us to claim absoluteness and finality for our understanding of it '' .
Newbiggin's qualification on the Christian claim is of considerable significance .
The Roman Catholic Church has excommunicated one of its priests , Father Feeney , for insisting that there is no salvation outside the visible church .
In mentioning this under `` salvation reconsidered '' I do not mean to imply that Roman Catholic doctrine has changed in this area but rather that it has become clearer to the world community what that doctrine is .
When they say that under no circumstances would it ever be right to `` permit '' the termination of the human race by human action , because there could not possibly be any proportionate grave reason to justify such a thing , they know exactly what they mean .
Of course , in prudential calculation , in balancing the good directly intended and done against the evil unintended and indirectly done , no greater precision can be forthcoming than the subject allows .
Yet it seems clear that there can be no good sufficiently great , or evil repelled sufficiently grave , to warrant the destruction of mankind by man's own action .
I mean , however , that the moral theologian knows what he means by `` permit '' .
He is not talking in the main about probabilities , risks and danger in general .
He is talking about an action which just as efficaciously does an evil thing ( and is known certainly and unavoidably to lead to this evil result ) as it efficaciously does some good .
He is talking about double effects , of which the specific action causes directly the one and indirectly the other , but causes both ; ;
of which one is deliberately willed or intended and the other not intended or not directly intended , but still both are done , while the evil effect is , with equal consciousness on the part of the agent , foreknown to be among the consequences .
This is what , in a technical sense , to `` only permit '' an evil result means .
It means to do it and to know one is doing it , but as only a secondary if certain effect of the good one primarily does and intends .
Of course , grave guiltiness may be imputed to the military action of any nation , or to the action of any leader or leaders , which for any supposed good `` permits '' , in this sense , the termination of the human race by human action .
Certainly , in analyzing an action which truly faced such alternatives , `` it is never possible that no world would be preferable to some worlds , and there are in truth no circumstances in which the destruction of human life presents itself as a reasonable alternative '' .
Naturally , where one or the other of the effects of an action is uncertain , this has to be taken into account .
Especially is this true when , because the good effect is remote and speculative while the evil is certain and grave , the action is prohibited .
Presumably , if the reverse is the case and the good effect is more certain than the evil result that may be forthcoming , not only must the good and the evil be prudentially weighed and found proportionate , but also calculation of the probabilities and of the degree of certainty or uncertainty in the good or evil effect must be taken into account .
There must not only be greater good than evil objectively in view , but also greater probability of actually doing more good than harm .
If an evil which is certain and extensive and immediate may rarely be compensated for by a problematic , speculative , future good , by the same token not every present , certain , and immediate good ( or lesser evil ) that may have to be done will be outweighed by a problematic , speculative , and future evil .
Nevertheless , according to the traditional theory , a man begins in the midst of action and he analyzes its nature and immediate consequences before or while putting it forth and causing these consequences .
He does not expect to be able to trammel up all the future consequences of his action .
Above all , he does not debate mere contingencies , and therefore , if these are possibly dreadful , find himself forced into inaction .
He does what he can and may and must , without regarding himself as lord of the future or , on the other hand , as covered with guilt by accident or unforeseen consequences or by results he did not `` permit '' in the sense explained .
By contrast , a good deal of nuclear pacifism begins with the contingencies and the probabilities , and not with the moral nature of the action to be done ; ;
and by deriving legitimate decision backward from whatever may conceivably or possibly or probably result , whether by anyone's doing or by accident , it finds itself driven to inaction , to non-political action in politics and non-military action in military affairs , and to the not very surprising discovery that there are now no distinctions on which the defense of justice can possibly be based .
Mr. Philip Toynbee writes , for example , that `` in terms of probability it is surely as likely as not that mutual fear will lead to accidental war in the near future if the present situation continues .
If it continues indefinitely it is nearly a statistical certainty that a mistake will be made and that the devastation will begin '' .
Against such a termination of human life on earth by human action , he then proposes as an alternative that we `` negotiate at once with the Russians and get the best terms which are available '' , that we deliberately `` negotiate from comparative weakness '' .
He bravely attempts to face this alternative realistically , i.e. , by considering the worst possible outcome , namely , the total domination of the world by Russia within a few years .
This would be by far the better choice , when `` it is a question of allowing the human race to survive , possibly under the domination of a regime which most of us detest , or of allowing it to destroy itself in appalling and prolonged anguish '' .
Nevertheless , the consequence of the policy proposed is everywhere subtly qualified : it is `` a possible result , however improbable '' ; ;
`` the worst , and least probable '' result ; ;
`` if it didn't prevail mankind would still be given the opportunity of prevailing '' ; ;
for `` surely anything is better than a policy which allows for the possibility of nuclear war '' .
If we have not thought and made a decision entirely in these terms , then we need to submit ourselves to the following `` simple test '' : `` Have we decided how we are to kill the other members of our household in the event of our being less injured than they are '' ? ?
Thus , moral decision must be entirely deduced backward from the likely eventuality ; ;
it is no longer to be formulated in terms of the nature of present action itself , its intention , and proximate effect or the thing to be done .
Several of the replies to Mr. Toynbee , without conscious resort to the traditional terminology with regard to the permission of evil , succeed in restoring the actual context in which present moral and political decisions must be made , by distinguishing between choosing a great evil and choosing in danger of this evil .
`` It is worse for a nation to give in to evil than to run the risk of annihilation '' .
`` I am consciously prepared to run the continued risk of ' race suicide by accident ' rather than accept the alternative certainty of race slavery by design .
But I can only make this choice because I believe that the risk need not increase , but may be deliberately reduced '' ( by precautions against accidents or by limiting war ? ?
) `` Quoting Mr. Kennan's phrase that anything would be better than a policy which led inevitably to nuclear war , he ( Toynbee ) says that anything is better than a policy which allows for the possibility of nuclear war '' .
`` If asked to choose between a terrible probability and a more terrible possibility , most men will choose the latter '' .
`` If Philip Toynbee is claiming that the choice lies between capitulation and the risk of nuclear war , I think he is right .
I do not accept that the choice is between capitulation and the certainty of nuclear war '' .
Even Professor Arnold Toynbee , agreeing with his son , does so in these terms : `` Compared to continuing to incur a constant risk of the destruction of the human race , all other evils are lesser evils .
Let us therefore put first things first , and make sure of preserving the human race at whatever the temporary price may be '' .
Mr. Philip Toynbee affirms at one point that if he shared the anticipations of Orwell in Nineteen Eighty-Four , if he believed Communism was not only evil but `` also irredeemably evil '' , then he might `` think it right to do anything rather than to take the risk of a communist world .
Even a nuclear holocaust is a little less frightful to contemplate than a race of dehumanised humans occupying the earth until doomsday '' .
No political order or economic system is so clearly contrary to nature .
But one does not have to affirm the existence of an evil order irredeemable in that sense , or a static order in which no changes will take place in time , to be able truthfully to affirm the following fact : there has never been justitia imprinted in social institutions and social relationships except in the context of some pax-ordo preserved by clothed or naked force .
On their way to the Heavenly City the children of God make use of the pax-ordo of the earthly city and acknowledge their share in responsibility for its preservation .
Not to repel injury and uphold and improve pax-ordo means not simply to accept the misshapen order and injustice that challenges it at the moment , but also to start down the steep slope along which justice can find no place whereon to stand .
Toynbee seems to think that there is some other way to give justice social embodiment .
`` I would far rather die after a Russian occupation of this country -- by some deliberate act of refusal -- than die uselessly by atomisation '' .
Would such an act of refusal be useful ? ?
He does not mean , in fact he addresses himself specifically to reject the proposition , that `` if we took the risk of surrendering , a new generation in Britain would soon begin to amass its strength in secret in order to reverse the consequences of that surrender '' .
He wants to be `` brutally frank and say that these rebellions would be hopeless -- far , far more hopeless than was the Hungarian revolution of 1956 '' .
This is not a project for regaining the ground for limited war , by creating a monopoly in one power of the world's arsenal of unlimited weapons .
It is a proposal that justice now be served by means other than those that have ever preconditioned the search for it , or preconditioned more positive means for attaining it , in the past .
`` It is no good recommending surrender rather than nuclear warfare with the proviso that surrender could be followed by the effective military resistance by occupied peoples .
Hope for the future would lie in the natural longing of the human race for freedom and the right to develop '' .
This is to surrender in advance to whatever attack may yet be mounted , to the very last ; ;
it is to stride along the steep slope downward .
The only contrary action , in the future as in the past , runs the risk of war ; ;
and , now and in the future unlike in the past , any attempt to repel injury and to preserve any particular civilized attainment of mankind or its provisional justice runs some risk of nuclear warfare and the danger that an effect of it will , by human action , render this planet less habitable by the human race .
That is why it is so very important that ethical analysis keep clear the problem of decision as to `` permitted '' effects , and not draw back in fright from any conceivable contingency or suffer paralysis of action before possibilities or probabilities unrelated , or not directly morally related , to what we can and may and must do as long as human history endures .
Finally , just as no different issues are posed for thoughtful analysis by the foreshortening of time that may yet pass before the end of human life on this earth , but only stimulation and alarm to the imagination , the same thing must be said in connection with the question of what we may perhaps already be doing , by human action , to accelerate this end .
We should not allow the image of an immanent end brought about indirectly by our own action in the continuing human struggle for a just endurable order of existence to blind us to the fact that in some measure accelerating the end of our lease may be one consequence among others of many other of mankind's thrusts toward we know not what future .
Much more than shelter , housing symbolizes social status , a sense of `` belonging '' , acceptance within a given group or neighborhood , identification with particular cultural values and social institutions , feelings of pride and worth , aspirations and hopes basic to human well-being .
For almost one-sixth of the national population discrimination in the free selection of residence casts a considerable shadow upon these values assumed as self-evident by most Americans .
Few business groups in recent years have come under heavier pressure to face these realities than real estate brokers and home builders .
This pressure has urged re-evaluation of the assumptions underlying their professional ethics ; ;
it has sought new sympathy for the human aspirations of racial minority groups in this country .
It is not surprising that , as spokesman for real estate interests , the National Association of Real Estate Boards ( NAREB ) and its local associations have sought to limit and often ignore much of this pressure .
How does the local realtor see himself in the context of housing restrictions based on race , religion or ethnic attachment ? ?
What does he conceive his role to be in this area of social unrest ? ?
What ought to be , what is his potential role as a force for constructive social change ? ?
What social , ethical and theological insights can the church and university help him bring to bear upon his situation ? ?
Recently , a group of the faculty at Wesleyan University's Public Affairs Center sought some answers to these questions .
Several New England realtors were invited to participate in a small colloquium of property lawyers , political scientists , economists , social psychologists , social ethicists and theologians .
Here , in an atmosphere of forthrightness and mutual criticism , each sought to bring his particular insights to bear upon the question of discrimination in housing and the part each man present played in it .
For a number of years , Wesleyan has been drawing varied groups of political and business leaders into these informal discussions with members of the faculty and student body , attempting to explore and clarify aspects of their responsibility for public policy .
This article presents our observations of that session , of the realtors as they saw themselves and as the faculty and students saw them .
Such conversation quickly reveals an ethically significant ambivalence in the self-images held by most realtors .
Within the membership of this group , as has been found true of men in other professional or trade associations , the most ready portrayal of oneself to `` the public '' is that of a neutral agent simply serving the interests of a seller or buyer and mediating between them .
Professional responsibility is seen to consist largely in serving the wishes of the client fairly and in an efficient manner .
But as conversation goes on , particularly among the realtors themselves , another image emerges , that of considerable power and influence in the community .
Obviously , much more than customer expectation is determining the realtor's role .
Judgments are continually rendered regarding the potential buyers' income , educational level and above all , racial extraction ; ;
and whether these would qualify them for `` congenial '' , `` happy '' relations to other people in certain community areas .
A narrow professionalism
How explicit such factors have been historically is evident in any chronology of restrictive covenant cases or in a review of NAREB's Code of Ethics Article 34 in the Code , adopted in 1924 , states that `` a Realtor should never be instrumental in introducing into a neighborhood a character of property or occupancy , members of any race or nationality or any individuals whose presence will clearly be detrimental to property values in that neighborhood '' .
Though the reference to race was stricken by the association in 1950 , being an agent of such `` detrimental '' influences still appears as the cardinal sin realtors see themselves committed to avoid .
The rationale for this avoidance was most frequently expressed in economic terms ; ;
all feared the supposed stigma they believed would inevitably attach to any realtor who openly introduced non-white , particularly Negro , peoples into all-white , restricted areas .
They would become tagged as men not interested in being purely real estate `` professionals '' but agitators for some kind of `` cause '' or `` reform '' , and this was no longer to be a `` pro '' .
Obviously what we are confronted with here is the identification of `` professional '' with narrow skills and specialization , the effective servicing of a client , rather than responsiveness to the wider and deeper meaning and associations of one's work .
These men -- for the most part educated in our `` best '' New England colleges , well established financially and socially in the community -- under kindly but insistent probing , reveal little or no objective or explicit criteria or data for their generalizations about the interests and attitudes of the people they claim to serve , or about the public responses that actually follow their occasional breach of a `` client-service relationship '' .
This narrow `` professionalism '' does not even fit the present realities of their situation , as the pressure of minorities and the power and respectability of the realtors increase .
As our discussion continued , the inadequacy of the `` client relationship '' as an interpretation of their `` way of operating '' became evident .
Realtors live in their communities as specialists in a given area of work , as members of social and professional organizations , as citizens and civic leaders , as church laymen , as university alumni , as newspaper readers , etc. .
From such communal roles the realtor finds the substance that shapes his moral understanding .
It seems to us that choices exercised by realtors in moral situations center in at least three areas : ( 1 ) the various ways in which they interpret a particular social issue ; ;
( 2 ) their pattern of involvement in the regular legal and political processes ; ;
and , most pervasively , ( 3 ) their interpretation of who is a `` real pro '' , of what it means to be a professional man in a technical , fragmented society .
( 1 ) Most of the realtors minimized their own understanding of and role in the racial issue , pleading that they only reflect the attitudes and intentions of their society .
There is some reality to this ; ;
the Commission on Race and Housing concluded that `` there is no reason to believe that real estate men are either more or less racially prejudiced , on the whole , than any other segment of the American population '' .
But such a reaction obscures the powerful efforts made in the past by both NAREB and its local boards for the maintenance of restrictive clauses and practices .
Also , it does not recognize the elements of choice and judgment continually employed .
Like business and university groups generally , these men had very limited knowledge of recent sociological and psychological studies and findings that might illumine the decisions they make .
Realtors , both generally and in this group , have invariably equated residential integration with a decline in property values , a circumstance viewed with considerable apprehension .
Recent studies by the Commission on Race and Housing and others , however , point to a vast complex of factors that often do not warrant this conclusion .
There are increasing numbers of neighborhoods that are integrated residentially without great loss of property values , the white population having taken the initiative in preparing the areas for an appreciation of the Negroes' desire for well-kept housing , privacy , etc. .
Data on the decline of property values in an area after a new racial group enters it has to be assessed in terms of the trends in property values before the group comes in .
Often they are able to get in only because the area is declining economically .
Significantly , no realtor and few of the faculty present were familiar with any of the six volumes ( published by the University of California Press ) that present the commission's findings .
No one anticipates any radical shift in this situation , but questions concerning reading habits , the availability of such data and the places where it is discussed must surely be raised .
The role of both church and university as sources of information and settings within which the implications of such information may be explored needs consideration .
Relevant `` facts '' , however , extend beyond considerations of property values and maintenance of `` harmonious '' neighborhoods .
Discussion of minority housing necessarily involves such basic issues as the intensity of one's democratic conviction and religious belief concerning equality of opportunity , the function and limitations of government in the securing of such equality , and the spotlight that world opinion plays upon local incidents of racial agitation and strife .
`` Against the grain of creation ''
( 2 ) Realtors realize , of course , that they are involved in an increasingly complex legal and political system that is opening up opportunities for leverage on their relation to clients as well as opportunities for evasion of their responsibility for racial discrimination in housing .
On the positive side , recent Federal action has largely undermined the legal sanction so long enjoyed by the segregationist position ; ;
anti-discriminatory statutes in housing have now been adopted by thirteen states and , while specific provisions have varied , the tendency is clearly toward expanding coverage .
Realtors in attendance at the colloquium expressed interest , for example , in Connecticut's new housing law as setting standards of equity that they would like `` to have to obey '' , but in support of which none had been willing to go on public record .
As far as they were aware , the Connecticut Association of Real Estate Boards had not officially opposed the bill's passage or lobbied in its support .
( This has not been the case everywhere .
In 1957 , the Real Estate Boards of New York City actively opposed the then pending private housing anti-discrimination law .
Official reasoning : the bill was a `` wanton invasion of basic property rights '' .
)
There are sins of omission as well as commission ; ;
the attitude adopted by realtors and their associations , either negative or positive , plays a large part in the public acceptance of such measures and the degree to which they may be effectively enforced .
Judicial opinion since the Supreme Court decision on Shelley v. Kraemer ( 1948 ) has rendered racial restrictive covenants unenforcible .
Such a decision should have placed a powerful weapon in the hands of the entire housing industry , but there is little evidence that realtors , or at least their associations , have repudiated the principle in such clauses .
In the states that have passed laws preventing discrimination in the sale or rental of housing , support by real estate associations for compliance and broadened coverage through additional legislation could help remove the label of `` social reformism '' that most realtors individually seem determined to avoid .
But as yet , no real estate board has been willing officially to support such laws or to admit the permissibility of introducing minority buyers into all-white neighborhoods .
One of the roles of the social scientist , ethicist or theologian in our discussions with the realtors became that of encouraging greater awareness of the opportunities offered by the legal and political processes for the exercise of broad social responsibilities in their work .
But responsiveness to these opportunities presumes that all of us judge the good as a human good and not simply as a professional , white , American good .
Such judgments are meaningful only in so far as persons are members of a world , let us say a community , that embraces Scarsdale or Yonkers , but is also infinitely richer since it is all-inclusive .
That community of all creation is , then , the ultimate object of our loyalty and the concrete norm of all moral judgment .
Racial discrimination is wrong , then , not because it goes against the grain of a faculty member trying to converse with a few realtors but because it goes against the grain of creation and against the will of the Creator .
Thus , moral issues concerning the nature of the legal and political processes take on theological dimensions .
A fragmented Society
( 3 ) Over the years , individuals engaged in the sale of real estate have developed remarkable unity in the methods and practices employed .
Most realtors and real estate brokers talk of themselves as `` professional people '' with the cultural and moral values held by the traditional professions .
But what significance attaches to `` professional '' , beyond the narrow sense of skillfulness in meeting a client's stated needs as already noted ? ?
Our faculty and students pressed this issue more than any other .
As a theologian in the group pointed out , a professional was , before the modern period of technical specialization , one who `` professed '' to be a bearer and critic of his culture in the use of his particular skills .
If we look about the world today , we can see clearly that there are two especially significant factors shaping the future of our civilization : science and religion .
Science is placing in our hands the ultimate power of the universe , the power of the atom .
Religion , or the lack of it , will decide whether we use this power to build a brave new world of peace and abundance for all mankind , or whether we misuse this power to leave a world utterly destroyed .
How can we have the wisdom to meet such a new and difficult challenge ? ?
We may feel pessimistic at the outlook .
And yet there is a note of hope , because this same science that is giving us the power of the atom is also giving us atomic vision .
We are looking inside the atom and seeing there a universe which is not material but something beyond the material , a universe that in a word is not matter but music .
And it is in this new vision of the atom that we find an affirmation and an invigoration of our faith .
Atomic energy
To see this vision in perspective , we need first of all a clear idea of the magnitude of this new power from the atom .
You know that I could hold right here in my hand the little chunk of uranium metal that was the heart of the bomb that dropped on Hiroshima .
It was only about the size of a baseball ; ;
but packed in that metallic ball there was the explosive force of 20,000 tons of Aj .
That is enough TNT to fill the tower of the Empire State Building ; ;
and with the availability of bombs of that size , war became a new problem .
Now we might have restricted the use of uranium bombs by controlling the sources of uranium because it is found in only a few places in the world .
But we had hardly started to adjust our thinking to this new uranium weapon when we were faced with the hydrogen bomb .
Hydrogen is just as plentiful as uranium is scarce .
We know that we have hydrogen in water ; ;
water is Af and the H stands for hydrogen ; ;
there is also hydrogen in wood and hydrogen in our bodies .
I have calculated that if I could snap my fingers in one magic gesture to release the power of all the hydrogen in my body , I would explode with the force of a hundred bombs of the kind that fell on Hiroshima .
I won't try the experiment , but I think you can see that if we all knew the secret and we could all let ourselves go , there would be quite an explosion .
And then think how little hydrogen we have in us compared with the hydrogen in Delaware Bay or in the ocean beyond .
Salt water is still Af , the same hydrogen is there .
And the size of the ocean shows us the magnitude of the destructive power we hold in our hands today .
Of course , there is also an optimistic side to the picture .
For if I knew the secret of letting this power in my body change directly into electricity , I could rent myself out to the electric companies and with just the power in my body I could light all the lights and run all the factories in the entire United States for some days .
And think , if we all knew this secret and we could pool our power , what a wonderful public utility company we would make .
With just the hydrogen of our bodies , we could run the world for years .
Then think of Delaware Bay and the ocean and you see that we have a supply of power for millions of years to come .
It is power with which we can literally rebuild the world , provide adequate housing , food , education , abundant living for everyone everywhere .
An octillion atoms
Now let us see where this power comes from .
To grasp our new view of the atom , we have to appreciate first of all how small the atom is .
I have been trying to make this clear to my own class in chemistry .
One night there were some dried peas lying on our kitchen table , and these peas looked to me like a little group of atoms ; ;
and I asked myself a question : Suppose I had the same number of peas as there are atoms in my body , how large an area would they cover ? ?
I calculated first that there are about an octillion atoms in the average human body ; ;
that is a figure one with 27 ciphers , quite a large number .
Then I calculated that a million peas would just about fill a household refrigerator ; ;
a billion peas would fill a small house from cellar to attic ; ;
a trillion peas would fill all the houses in a town of about ten thousand people ; ;
and a quadrillion peas would fill all the buildings in the city of Philadelphia .
I saw that I would soon run out of buildings at this rate , so I decided to take another measure -- the whole state of Pennsylvania .
Imagine that there is a blizzard over Pennsylvania , but instead of snowing snow , it snows peas ; ;
so we get the whole state covered with peas , about four feet deep .
You can imagine what it would look like going out on the turnpike with the peas banked up against the houses and covering the cars ; ;
Pennsylvania thus blanketed would contain about a quintillion peas .
But we still have a long way to go .
Next we imagine our blizzard raging over all the land areas of the entire globe -- North America , South America , Europe , Asia , and Africa , all covered with peas four feet deep ; ;
then we have sextillion peas .
Next we freeze over the oceans and cover the whole earth with peas , then we go out among the neighboring stars , collect 250 planets each the size of the earth , and also cover each of these with peas four feet deep ; ;
and then we have septillion .
Finally we go into the farthest reaches of the Milky Way ; ;
we get 250,000 planets ; ;
we cover each of these with our blanket of peas and then at last we have octillion peas corresponding in number to the atoms in the body .
So you see how small an atom is and how complicated you are .
A speck -- and space
Now although an atom is small , we can still in imagination have a look at it .
Let us focus on an atom of calcium from the tip of the bone of my finger and let us suppose that I swallow a magic Alice In Wonderland growing pill .
I start growing rapidly and this calcium atom grows along with me .
I shoot up through the roof , into the sky , past the clouds , through the stratosphere , out beyond the moon , out among the planets , until I am over a hundred and fifty million miles long .
Then this atom of calcium will swell to something like a great balloon a hundred yards across , a balloon big enough to put a football field inside .
And if you should step inside of such a magnified atom , according to the physics of forty years ago , you would see circulating over your head , down at the sides , and under your feet , some twenty luminous balls about the size of footballs .
These balls are moving in great circles and ellipses , and are of course , the electrons , the particles of negative electricity which by their action create the forces that tie this atom of calcium to the neighboring atoms of oxygen and make up the solid structure of my finger bone .
Since these electrons are moving like planets , you may wonder whether there is an atomic sun at the center of the atom .
So you look down there and you see a tiny , whirling point about the size of the head of a pin .
This is the atomic sun , the atomic nucleus .
Even if the atom were big enough to hold a football field , this nucleus is still only about the size of a pinhead .
It is this atomic nucleus that contains the positive charge of electricity holding these negatively charged electrons in their orbits ; ;
it also contains nearly all the mass , and the atomic energy .
You may ask what else there is , and the answer is nothing -- nothing but empty space .
And since you are made of atoms , you are nothing much but empty space , too .
If I could put your body in an imaginary atomic press and squeeze you down , squeeze these holes out of you in the way we squeeze the holes out of a sponge , you would get smaller and smaller until finally when the last hole was gone , you would be smaller than the smallest speck of dust that you could see on this piece of paper .
Someone has remarked that this is certainly the ultimate in reducing .
At any rate , it shows us how immaterial we are .
Music of the spheres
Now this 1920 view of the atom was on the whole a discouraging picture .
For we believed that the electrons obeyed the law of mechanics and electrodynamics ; ;
and therefore the atom was really just a little machine ; ;
and in mechanics the whole is no more than the sum of the parts .
So if you are made of atoms , you are just a big machine ; ;
and since the universe is also made of atoms , it is just a supermachine .
And this would mean that we live in a mechanistic universe , governed by the laws of cause and effect , bound in chains of determinism that hold the universe on a completely predetermined course in which there is not room for soul or spirit or human freedom .
And this is why so many scientists a half a century ago were agnostics or atheists .
Then came the scientific revolution in the late 1920's .
A suggestion from Louis De Broglie , a physicist in France , showed us that these electrons are not point particles but waves .
And to see the meaning of this new picture , imagine that you can put on more powerful glasses and go back inside the atom and have a look at it in the way we view it today .
Now as you step inside , instead of seeing particles orbiting around like planets , you see waves and ripples very much like the ripples that you get on the surface of a pond when you drop a stone into it .
These ripples spread out in symmetrical patterns like the rose windows of a great cathedral .
And as the waves flow back and forth and merge with the waves from the neighboring atoms , you can put on a magic hearing aid and you hear music .
It is a music like the music from a great organ or a vast orchestra playing a symphony .
Harmony , melody , counterpoint symphonic structure are there ; ;
and as this music ebbs and flows , there is an antiphonal chorus from all the atoms outside , in fact from the atoms of the entire universe .
And so today when we examine the structure of our knowledge of the atom and of the universe , we are forced to conclude that the best word to describe our universe is music .
The Island of Nantucket , part of the State of Massachusetts , lies about thirty-one miles southeast of its mother State .
Some of the Island is sand and is not suitable for living .
The Island folk have their living almost entirely from summer visitors ; ;
the rest is obtained from harbor scallops .
During about three and a half months of the year , in the summer , there are three boats that run from the mainland to the Island carrying passengers , food , and cars ; ;
but the rest of the year only one boat is needed , which ties up at the mainland nights and makes the trip down to Nantucket in the daytime .
This is a fine trip , too , on a good day .
With Martha's Vineyard on one side and the open sea on the other , it makes an excellent trip of about three hours .
To what extent and in what ways did Christianity affect the United States of America in the nineteenth century ? ?
How far and in what fashion did it modify the new nation which was emerging in the midst of the forces shaping the revolutionary age ? ?
To what extent did it mould the morals and the social , economic , and political life and institutions of the country ? ?
A complete picture is impossible -- partly because of the limitations of space , partly because for millions of individuals who professed allegiance to the Christian faith data are unobtainable .
Even more of an obstacle is the difficulty of separating the influence of Christianity from other factors .
Although a complete picture cannot be given , we can indicate some aspects of life into which the Christian faith entered as at least one creative factor .
At times we can say that it was the major factor .
What in some ways was the most important aspect was the impact individually on the millions who constituted the nation .
As we have seen , a growing proportion , although in 1914 still a minority , were members of churches .
Presumably those who did not have a formal church connexion had also felt the influence of Christianity to a greater or lesser extent .
Many of them had once been members of a church or at least had been given instruction in Christianity but for one or another reason had allowed the connexion to lapse .
The form of Christianity to which they were exposed was for some the Protestantism of the older stock , for others the Protestantism of the nineteenth-century immigration ; ;
for still others , mostly of the nineteenth-century immigration , it was Roman Catholicism , and for a small minority it was Eastern Orthodoxy .
Upon all of them played the intellectual , social , political , and economic attitudes , institutions , and customs of the nation .
Upon most of these Christianity had left an impress and through them had had a share in making the individual what he was .
Yet to determine precisely to what extent and exactly in what ways any individual showed the effects of Christianity would be impossible .
At best only an approximation could be arrived at .
To generalize for the entire nation would be absurd .
For instance , we cannot know whether even for church members the degree of conformity to Christian standards of morality increased or declined as the proportion of church members in the population rose .
The temptation is to say that , as the percentage of church members mounted , the degree of discipline exercised by the churches lessened and the trend was towards conformity to the general level .
Yet this cannot be proved .
We know that in the early part of the century many Protestant congregations took positive action against members who transgressed the ethical codes to which the majority subscribed .
Thus Baptist churches on the frontier took cognizance of charges against their members of drunkenness , fighting , malicious gossip , lying , cheating , sexual irregularities , gambling , horse racing , and failure to pay just debts .
If guilty , the offender might be excluded from membership .
As church membership burgeoned , such measures faded into desuetude .
But whether this was accompanied by a general lowering of the moral life of the membership we do not know .
What we can attempt with some hope of dependable conclusions is to point out the manner in which Christianity entered into particular aspects of the life of the nation .
We have already hinted at the fashion in which Christianity contributed to education and so to intellectual life .
We will now speak of the ways in which it helped shape the ideals of the country and of the manner in which it stimulated efforts to attain those ideals through reform movements , through programmes for bringing the collective life to the nation to conformity to Christian standards , and through leaders in the government .
Throughout the nineteenth century Christianity exerted its influence on American society as a whole primarily through the Protestantism of the older stock .
By the end of the century the Roman Catholic Church was beginning to make itself felt , mainly through such institutions as hospitals but also through its attitude towards organized labour .
In the twentieth century its influence grew , as did that of the Protestantism of the nineteenth-century immigration .
The American dream
The ideals of the country were deeply indebted to the Protestantism of the older stock .
Thus `` America '' , the most widely sung of the patriotic songs , was written by a New England Baptist clergyman , Samuel Francis Smith ( 1808-1895 ) , while a student in Andover Theological Seminary .
With its zeal for liberty and its dependence on God it breathed the spirit which had been nourished on the Evangelical revivals .
The great seal of the United States was obviously inspired by the Christian faith .
Here was what was called the American dream , namely , the effort to build a structure which would be something new in history and to do so in such fashion that God could bless it .
Later in the century the dream again found expression in the lines of Katherine Lee Bates ( 1859-1929 ) , daughter and granddaughter of New England Congregational ministers , in her widely sung hymn , written in 1893 , `` America The Beautiful '' , with the words `` O beautiful for pilgrim feet whose stern impassioned stress a thoroughfare for freedom beat across the wilderness .
America , America , God mend thy every flaw , confirm thy soul in self control , the liberty in law .
O beautiful for patriot dream that sees beyond the years thine alabaster cities gleam undimmed by human tears .
America , America , God shed His grace on thee , and crown thy good with brotherhood from sea to shining sea '' .
The American dream was compounded of many strains .
Some were clearly of Christian origin , among them the Great Awakening and other revivals which helped to make Christian liberty , Christian equality , and Christian fraternity the passion of the land .
Some have seen revivalism and the search for Christian perfection as the fountain-head of the American hope .
Here , too , must be placed Unitarianism and , less obviously from Christian inspiration , Emerson , Transcendentalism , and the idealism of Walt Whitman .
We must also remember those who reacted against the dream as a kind of myth -- among them Melville , Hawthorne , and Henry James the elder , all of them out of a Christian background .
Reform movements
With such a dream arising , at least in part , from the Protestant heritage of the United States and built into the foundations of the nation , it is not surprising that many efforts were made to give it concrete expression .
A number were in the nature of movements to relieve or remove social ills .
Significantly , the initiation and leadership of a major proportion of the reform movements , especially those in the first half of the nineteenth century , came from men and women of New England birth or parentage and from either Trinitarian or Unitarian Congregationalism .
Several of the movements were given a marked impetus by revivalism .
Quakers , some from New England , had a larger share than their proportionate numerical strength would have warranted .
We do well to remind ourselves that from men and women of New England ancestry also issued the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints , the Seventh Day Adventists , Christian Science , the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions , the American Home Missionary Society , the American Bible Society , and New England theology .
The atmosphere was one of optimism , of confidence in human progress , and of a determination to rid the world of its ills .
The Hopkinsian universal disinterested benevolence , although holding to original sin and the doctrine of election , inspired its adherents to heroic endeavours for others , looked for the early coming of the Millennium , and was paralleled by the confidence in man's ability cherished by the Unitarians , Emerson , and the Transcendentalists .
We should recall the number of movements for the service of mankind which arose from the kindred Evangelicalism of the British Isles and the Pietism of the Continent of Europe -- among them prison reform , anti-slavery measures , legislation for the alleviation of conditions of labour , the Inner Mission , and the Red Cross .
We cannot take the space to record all the efforts for the removal or alleviation of collective ills .
A few of the more prominent must serve as examples of what a complete listing and description would disclose .
Several were born in the early decades and persisted throughout the century .
Others were ephemeral .
Some disappeared with the attainment of their purpose .
Still others sprang up late in the century to meet conditions which arose from fresh stages of the revolutionary age .
The anti-slavery movement
The movement to end Negro slavery began before 1815 and mounted after that year until , as a result of the Civil War , emancipation was achieved .
Long before 1815 the Christian conscience was leading some to declare slavery wrong and to act accordingly .
For example , in 1693 the Philadelphia Yearly Meeting of Friends declared that its members should emancipate their slaves and in 1776 it determined to exclude from membership all who did not comply .
In the latter year Samuel Hopkins , from whom the Hopkinsian strain of New England theology took its name , asked the Continental Congress to abolish slavery .
As we have seen , Methodism early took a stand against slavery .
Beginning at least as far back as 1789 various Baptist bodies condemned slavery .
After 1815 anti-slavery sentiment mounted , chiefly among Protestants and those of Protestant background of the older stock .
The nineteenth-century immigration , whether Protestant or Roman Catholic , was not so much concerned , for very few if any among them held slaves : they were mostly in the Northern states where slavery had disappeared or was on the way out , or were too poverty-stricken to own slaves .
The anti-slavery movement took many forms .
Benjamin Lundy ( 1789-1839 ) , a Quaker , was a pioneer in preparing the way for anti-slavery societies .
It was he who turned the attention of William Lloyd Garrison ( 1805-1879 ) to the subject .
Garrison , Massachusetts born of Nova Scotian parentage , was by temperament and conviction a reformer .
Chiefly remembered because of his incessant advocacy of `` immediate and unconditional abolition '' , he also espoused a great variety of other causes -- among them women's rights , prohibition , and justice to the Indians .
Incurably optimistic , dogmatic , and utterly fearless , in his youth a devout Baptist , in spite of his friendship for the Quaker poet John Greenleaf Whittier ( 1807-1892 ) he eventually attacked the orthodox churches for what he deemed their cowardly compromising on the slavery issue and in his invariably ardent manner was emphatically unorthodox and denied the plenary inspiration of the Bible .
A marked impulse came to the anti-slavery movement through the Finney revivals .
Finney himself , while opposed to slavery , placed his chief emphasis on evangelism , but from his converts issued much of the leadership of the anti-slavery campaign .
Theodore Dwight Weld ( 1803-1895 ) was especially active .
Weld was the son and grandson of New England Congregational ministers .
As a youth he became one of Finney's band of evangelists and gave himself to winning young men .
A strong temperance advocate , through the influence of a favorite teacher , Charles Stewart , another Finney convert , he devoted himself to the anti-slavery cause .
A group of young men influenced by him enrolled in Lane Theological Seminary and had to leave because of their open anti-slavery position .
The majority then went to the infant Oberlin .
They and others employed some of Finney's techniques as they sought to win adherents to the cause .
Weld contributed to the anti-slavery convictions of such men as Joshua R. Giddings and Edwin M. Stanton , enlisted John Quincy Adams , and helped provide ideas which underlay Harriet Beecher Stowe's Uncle Tom's Cabin .
He shunned publicity for himself and sought to avoid fame .
Wendell Phillips ( 1811-1884 ) , from a prominent Massachusetts family , in his teens was converted under the preaching of Lyman Beecher .
Although he later broke with the churches because he believed that they were insufficiently outspoken against social evils , he remained a devout Christian .
He was remembered chiefly for his fearless advocacy of abolition , but he also stood for equal rights for women , for opportunity for the freedmen , and for prohibition .
The anti-slavery movement and other contemporary reforms and philanthropies were given leadership and financial undergirding by Arthur Tappan ( 1786-1865 ) and his younger brother , Lewis Tappan ( 1788-1873 ) .
Individuals possessing unusual gifts and great personal power were transmuted at death into awesome spirits ; ;
they were almost immediately worshipped for these newer , even more terrible abilities .
Their direct descendants inherited not only their worldly fortunes , but also the mandate of their newfound power as spirits in the other half of the universe .
Royal lineages could be based on extraordinary worldly achievements translated into eternal otherworldly power .
Thus , the emperor could draw on sources not available to those with less puissant ancestors .
But this eminence was not without its weighty responsibilities .
Since he possessed more power in an interdependent universe of living beings and dead spirits , the emperor had to use it for the benefit of the living .
The royal ritual generated power into the other world : it also provided the living with a way to control the spirits , and bring their powers directly to bear on the everyday affairs of the world .
Proper ritual observance at any level of society was capable of generating power for use in the spirit world ; ;
but naturally , the royal ritual , which provided unusual control over already supremely powerful divine spirits , was held responsible for regulating the universe and insuring the welfare of the kingdom .
This is the familiar system of `` cosmic government '' .
The Chinese emperor , by proper observance of ritual , manifested divine powers .
He regulated the dualities of light and darkness , Yang and Yin , which are locked in eternal struggle .
By swaying the balance between them , he effected the alternation of the seasons .
His power was so great that he even promoted and demoted gods according to whether they had given ear or been deaf to petitions .
In this system , no man is exempt from obligations .
Failure in daily moral and ethical duties to one's family , outrages to community propriety , any departure from rigid standards of moral excellence were offenses against the dead .
And to offend the dead meant to incur their wrath , and thus provoke the unleashing of countrywide disasters .
The family home was , in fact , a temple ; ;
and the daily duties of individuals were basically religious in nature .
The dead spirits occupied a prominent place in every hope and in every fear .
The common belief was that there existed one moral order , which included everything .
The dead controlled the material prosperity of the living , and the living adhered to strict codes of conduct in order not to weaken that control .
Men believed they could control nature by obeying a moral code .
If the moral code were flouted , the proper balance of the universe would be upset , and the disastrous result could be floods , plague , or famine .
Modern Westerners have difficulty comprehending this fusion of moral and material , largely because in the West the historical trend has been to deny the connection .
Living in urban conditions , away from the deadweight of village constraint and the constrictions of a thatched-roof world view , the individual may find it possible , say , to commit adultery not only without personal misgivings , but also without suffering any adverse effects in his worldly fortunes .
Basing action on the empirical determination of cause and effect provides a toughness and bravado that no powerful otherworldly ancestor could ever impart -- plus the added liberation from the constraint of silent burial urns .
In China , the magical system par excellence was Taoism .
The Taoists were Quietist mystics , who saw an unchanging unity -- the Tao -- underlying all phenomena .
It was this timeless unity that was all-important , and not its temporary manifestations in the world of reality .
The Taoists believed the unity could be influenced by proper magical manipulation ; ;
in other words , they were actually an organization of magicians .
Mahayana Buddhism was no exception to these prevailing magical concepts .
After this form of Indian Buddhism had been introduced into China , it underwent extensive changes .
During its flowering in the sixth to the eighth centuries , Mahayana offered a supernatural package to the Chinese which bears no resemblance to the highly digested philosophical Zen morsels offered to the modern Western reader .
Mahayana had gods , and magic , a pantheon , heavens and hells , and gorgeously appareled priests , monks , and nuns , all of whom wielded power over souls in the other world .
The self-realized Mahayana saint possessed superhuman powers and magic .
The Mahayana that developed in the north was a religion of idolatry and coarse magic , that made the world into a huge magical garden .
In its monastic form , Mahayana was merely an organization of magic-practicing monks ( bonzes ) , who catered to the Chinese faith in the supernatural .
Nonmagical Confucianism was a secular , rational philosophy , but even with this different orientation it could not escape from the ethos of a cosmic government .
Confucianism had its own magic in the idea that virtue had power .
If a man lived a classical life , he need not fear the spirits -- for only lack of virtue gave the spirits power over him .
But let us not be mistaken about Confucian `` virtue '' ; ;
this was not virtue as we understand the word today , and it did not mean an abandonment of the belief in magic manipulation .
To the Confucian , `` virtue '' simply meant mastery and correct observance of three hundred major rules of ritual and three thousand minor ones .
Propriety was synonymous with ritual observance , the mark of a true gentleman .
To live correctly in an interdependent moral and material universe of living and dead was decisive for man's fate .
This , in brief , was the historical background out of which Zen emerged .
Promoters of Zen to the West record its ancestry , and recognize that Zen grew out of a combination of Taoism and Indian Mahayana Buddhism .
But the `` marvelous person '' that is supposed to result from Zen exhibits more Chinese practicality than Indian speculation -- he possesses magical powers , and can use them to order nature and to redeem souls .
Proponents of Zen to the West emphasize disproportionately the amount of Mahayana Buddhism in Zen , probably in order to dignify the indisputably magical Taoist ideas with more respectable Buddhist metaphysic .
But in the Chinese mind , there was little difference between the two -- the bonzes were no more metaphysical than a magician has to be .
Actually , Zen owes more to Chinese Quietism than it does to Mahayana Buddhism .
The Ch'an ( Zen ) sect may have derived its metaphysic from Mahayana , but its psychology was pure early Taoist .
This is well evidenced by the Quietist doctrines carried over in Zen : the idea of the inward turning of thought , the enjoinder to put aside desires and perturbations so that a return to purity , peace , and stillness -- a union with the Infinite , with the Tao -- could be effected .
In fact , the antipathy to outward ceremonies hailed by modern exponents as so uniquely characteristic of the `` direct thinking '' Zennist was a feature of Taoism .
So , too , was the insistence on the relativity of the external world , and the ideas that language and things perceived by consciousness were poor substitutes indeed for immediate perception by pure , indwelling spirit : the opposition of pure consciousness to ratiocinating consciousness .
Zen maintains that cognitive things are only the surface of experience .
One of its features attractive to the West is its irreverence for tradition and dogma and for sacred texts .
One patriarch is supposed to have relegated sacred scriptures for use in an outhouse .
But this is not the spirit of self-reliant freedom of action for which the Westerner mistakes it .
It is simply that in Taoist tradition -- as in all good mysticisms -- books , words , or any other manifestations that belong to the normal state of consciousness are considered only the surface of experience .
The truth -- the Eternal Truth -- is not transmittable by words .
Reality is considered not only irrelevant to the acquisition of higher knowledge , but a positive handicap .
The technique of reality confusion -- the use of paradox and riddles to shake the mind's grip on reality -- originated with fourth and third century B.C. Chinese Quietism : the koan is not basically a new device .
It is important for an understanding of Zen to realize that the esoteric preoccupations of the select few cannot be the doctrine of the common man .
In the supernatural atmosphere of cosmic government , only the ruling elite was ever concerned with a kingdom-wide ordering of nature : popular religion aimed at more personal benefits from magical powers .
And this is only natural -- witness the haste with which modern man gobbles the latest `` wonder drug '' .
Early Chinese anchoritism was theoretically aimed at a mystic pantheist union with the divine , personal salvation being achieved when the mystical recluse united with divine essence .
But this esoteric doctrine was lost in the shuffle to acquire special powers .
The anchorite strove , in fact , to magically influence the world of spirits in the same way that the divine emperor manifested his power .
Thus , the Mahayana metaphysic of mystical union for salvation was distilled down to a bare self-seeking , and for this reason , the mystic in Asia did not long remain in isolated contemplation .
As the Zen literature reveals , as soon as an early Zen master attained fame in seclusion , he was called out into the world to exercise his powers .
The early Anchorite masters attracted disciples because of their presumed ability to perform miracles .
Exponents of Zen often insist that very early Zen doctrine opposed the rampant supernaturalism of China , and proposed instead a more mature , less credulous view of the universe .
In support of this , stories from the early literature are cited to show that Zen attacks the idea of supernatural power .
But actually these accounts reveal the supernatural powers that the masters were in fact supposed to possess , as well as the extreme degree of popular credulity : `` Hwang Pah ( O Baku ) , one day going up Mount Tien Tai which was believed to have been inhabited by Arhats with supernatural powers , met with a monk whose eyes emitted strange light .
They went along the pass talking with each other for a short while until they came to a river roaring with torrent .
There being no bridge , the master had to stop at the shore ; ;
but his companion crossed the river walking on the water and beckoned to Hwang Pah to follow him .
Thereupon Hwang Pah said : `` If I knew thou art an Arhat , I would have doubled you up before thou got over there '' ! !
The monk then understood the spiritual attainment of Hwang Pah , and praised him as a true Mahayanist .
( 1 ) ''
A second tale shows still more clearly the kind of powers a truly spiritual monk could possess : `` On one occasion Yang Shan ( Kyo-zan ) saw a stranger monk flying through the air .
When that monk came down and approached him with a respectful salutation , he asked : `` Where art thou from '' ? ?
`` Early this morning '' , replied the other , `` I set out from India '' .
`` Why '' , said the teacher , `` art thou so late '' ? ?
`` I stopped '' , responded the man , `` several times to look at beautiful sceneries '' .
`` Thou mayst have supernatural powers '' , exclaimed Yang Shan , `` yet thou must give back the Spirit of Buddha to me '' .
Then the monk praised Yang Shan saying : `` I have come over to China in order to worship Manjucri , and met unexpectedly with Minor Shakya '' , and after giving the master some palm leaves he brought from India , went back through the air .
( 2 ) ''
In the popular Chinese mind , Ch'an ( Zen ) was no exception to the ideas of coarse magic that dominated .
A closer look at modern Zen reveals many magical carryovers that are still part of popular Zen attitudes .
To the Zen monk the universe is still populated with `` spiritual beings '' who have to be appeased .
Part of the mealtime ritual in the Zendo consists in offerings of rice to the spiritual beings '' .
Modern Zen presentation to the West insists on the anti-authoritarian , highly pragmatic nature of the Zen belief -- scriptures are burned to make fire , action is based on direct self-confidence , and so on .
This picture of extreme self-reliant individuation is difficult to reconcile with such Zendo formulas as : `` O you , demons and other spiritual beings , I now offer this to you , and may this food fill up the ten quarters of the world and all the demons and other spiritual beings be fed therewith .

Pope Leo 13 , on the 13th day of December 1898 , granted the following indulgences : `` An indulgence of three hundred days is granted to all the Faithful who read the Holy Gospels at least a quarter of an hour .
A Plenary Indulgence under the usual conditions is granted once a month for the daily reading '' .
Pope Pius the Sixth , at Rome , in April , 1778 , wrote the following : `` The faithful should be excited to the reading of the Holy Scriptures : For these are the most abundant sources which ought to be left open to everyone , to draw from them purity of morals and of doctrine , to eradicate errors which are so widely disseminated in these corrupt times '' .
The American Bishops assembled at the Third Plenary Council of Baltimore urged the Catholic people to read the Holy Bible .
`` We hope '' , they said , `` that no family can be found amongst us without a correct version of the Holy Scriptures '' .
They recommended , also , that `` at a fixed hour , let the entire family be assembled for night prayers , followed by a short reading of the Holy Scriptures '' .
Since the Catholic Church expresses such desire that the Sacred Scriptures be read , the following taken from the Holy Bible ( New Catholic Edition ) will prove a means of grace and a source of great spiritual blessing .
The need of the new birth
Do not wonder that I said to thee , `` You must be born again '' .
St. John 3 : 7 .
The new birth is necessary because god is holy .
But as the One who called you is holy , be you also holy in all your behavior ; ;
for it is written , You shall be holy , because I am holy .
1 , St. Peter 15 , 16 .
Holiness without which no man will see God .
Hebrews 14 .
The new birth is necessary because all have sinned .
As it is written , There is not one just man ; ;
there is none who understands ; ;
there is none who seeks after God .
All have gone astray together ; ;
All have sinned and have need of the glory of God .
Romans 3 : 10-12 , 23 .
The new birth is necessary because the natural man is spiritually dead and blind .
Therefore as through one man sin entered into the world and through sin death , and thus death has passed unto all men because all have sinned .
Romans 12 .
You also , when you were dead by reason of your offenses and sins .
Ephesians 2 : 1 .
And if our gospel also is veiled , it is veiled only to those who are perishing .
In their case , the god of this world ( Satan ) has blinded their unbelieving minds , that they should not see the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ , who is the image of God .
2 , Corinthians 4 : 3 , 4 .
For his workmanship we are , created in Christ Jesus .
Ephesians 10 .
The new birth is effected through the word of God
.
For you have been reborn , not from corruptible seed but from incorruptible , through the word of God .
1 St. Peter 23 .
Of his own will he has begotten us by the word of truth .
St. James 18 .
Amen , amen , I say to thee , unless a man be born again of water ( symbol of the Word of God , see Ephesians 26 ) and the Spirit , he cannot enter into the kingdom of God .
That which is born of the flesh is flesh ; ;
and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit .
St. John 3 : 5 , 6 .
Evidences of the new birth
if we are born of god we have faith in Christ as the only saviour .
Everyone who believes that Jesus is the Christ is born of God .
1 St. John 5 : 1 .
As many as received him were born of God .
St. John 12 , 13 .
If we are born of God we do not practice sin as a habit .

Now to him who is able to preserve you without sin and to set you before the presence of his glory , without blemish , in gladness , to the only God our Savior , through Jesus Christ our Lord , belong glory and majesty , dominion and authority , before all time , and now , and forever .
St. Jude 24 .
The new birth is necessary because the spiritual kingdom requires a spiritual nature .
Jesus answered and said to him ( Nicodemus ) `` Amen , amen , I say to thee , unless a man be born again , he cannot see the kingdom of God '' .
`` Amen , amen , I say to thee , unless a man be born again of water and the Spirit , he cannot enter into the kingdom of God .
That which is born of the flesh is flesh ; ;
and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit .
Do not wonder that I said to thee , ' You must be born again ' '' .
St. John 3 : 3 , 5-7 .
The nature of the new birth
the new birth is a new creation .
For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision but a new creation is of any account .
Galatians 15 .
If then any man is in Christ , he is a new creature ( literally , `` He is a new creation ) , the former things have passed away ; ;
behold , they are made new ! !
2 Corinthians 17 .

And the life that I now live in the flesh , I live in the faith of the Son of God , who loved me and gave himself up for me .
Galatians 20 .
To have Christ dwelling through faith in your hearts .
Ephesians 17 .
The new birth is miraculous and mysterious .
The wind blows where it will , and thou hearest its sound but dost not know where it comes from or where it goes .
So is everyone who is born of the Spirit .

The new birth is immediate and instantaneous .
Amen , amen , I say to you , he who hears my word , and believes him who sent me , has life everlasting , and does not come to judgment , but has passed from death to life .
St. John 24 .
The means of the new birth
the new birth is a work of god .
But to as many as received him he gave the power of becoming sons of God ; ;
to those who believe in his name : Who were born not of blood , nor of the will of the flesh , nor of the will of man , but of God .
St. John 12 , 13 .
A final word
You may be very religious , a good church member , an upright , honest and sincere person ; ;
you may be baptized , confirmed , reverent and worshipful ; ;
you may attend mass , do penance , say prayers and zealously keep all the sacraments and ceremonies of the church ; ;
you may have the final and extreme unction but if you are not born again you are lost and headed for hell and eternal punishment .
You cannot be saved ; ;
you cannot go to heaven unless you are born again .
Our blessed Lord Jesus Christ , the sinless Son of God , who could not lie , said , `` Amen , amen , I say to thee , unless a man be born again , he cannot see the kingdom of God '' ( St. John 3 : 3 ) .
`` You must be born again '' ( St. John 3 : 7 ) .
Being convinced that salvation is alone by accepting Christ as Saviour , and being convicted by the Holy Spirit of my lost condition , I do repent of all effort to be saved by any form of good works , and just now receive Jesus as my personal Saviour and salvation as a free gift from Him .
You may do as you please with God now .
It is permitted .
God placed Himself in men's hands when He sent Jesus Christ into the world as perfect God and perfect Man in one Being .
He was then in man's hands .
They cursed Him .
It was permitted .
Men spit on Him .
God allowed it .
They called Him a devil .
God withheld His wrath .
Finally men arrested Him , gave Him a mock trial , flogged Him , nailed Him on a cross and hung Him between earth and heaven ; ;
and God allowed it .
You can do likewise though Christ is not bodily present .
You can ignore Him .
You can ignore His Book , the Bible , and His church .
You can laugh at His blood-bought salvation , curse His followers , and laugh at hell .
It is permitted .
The eternal Christ may knock at your soul's door , calling you to give up sin and prepare for heaven .
You may refuse Him , spit on Him , call Him a devil , curse Him .
It is permitted .
You may take His name upon your lips in oaths and curses if you so choose .
He is in your hands -- now .
On the other hand , you may seek His favor , humble yourself before Him and beg His mercy , implore His forgiveness , forsake your sins , and abandon your whole life to Him .
He has said , `` Behold , I stand at the door , and knock : if any man hear my voice , and open the door , I will come in to him , and will sup with him , and he with me '' ( Revelation 3:20 : :
20 ) .
The choice is up to you .
The latch is on your side of the door .
The choice is yours : the revellings and banquetings of this world or quiet communion with God ; ;
the ever burning lusts of the flesh or the powerful victory of Holy Spirit discipline .
The choice is yours : God is in your hands , now .
God has already set the day when you will be in His hands .
What He does with you then depends on what you do with Him now .
Then it will be a `` fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God '' if you have abused Him in your hands .
I am a magazine ; ;
my name is Guideposts ; ;
this issue that you are reading marks my 15th anniversary .
When I came into being , 15 years ago , I had one primary purpose : to help men and women everywhere to know God better , and through knowing Him better to become happier and more effective people .
That purpose has never changed .
When you read me , you are holding in your hands the product of many minds and hearts .
Some of the people who speak through my pages are famous ; ;
others unknown .
Some work with their hands .
Some have walked through pain and sorrow to bring you their message of hope .
Some are so filled with gratitude , for the gift of life and the love of God , that their joy spills out on the paper and brightens the lives of thousands whom they have never known , and will never see .
Fifteen years ago , there were no Guideposts at all .
This month a million Guideposts will circulate all over the world .
Experts in the publishing field consider this astounding .
They do not understand how a small magazine with no advertising and no newsstand sale could have achieved such a following .
To me , the explanation is very simple .
I am not doing anything , of myself .
I am merely a channel for something .
What is this something ? ?
I cannot define it fully .
It is the force in the universe that makes men love goodness , even when they turn away from it .
It is the power that holds the stars in their orbits , but allows the wind to bend a blade of grass .
It is the whisper in the heart that urges each one to be better than he is .
It is mankind's wistful yearning for a world of justice and peace .
All things are possible to God , but He chooses -- usually -- to work through people .
Sometimes such people sense that they are being used ; ;
sometimes not .
Fifteen years ago , troubled by the rising tide of materialism in the post-war world , a businessman and a minister asked themselves if there might not be a place for a small magazine in which men and women , regardless of creed or color , could set forth boldly their religious convictions and bear witness to the power of faith to solve the endless problems of living .
The businessman was Raymond Thornburg .
The minister was Norman Vincent Peale .
Neither had any publishing experience , but they had faith in their idea .
They borrowed a typewriter , raised about $2,000 in contributions , hired a secretary , persuaded a couple of young men to join them for almost no pay and began mailing out a collection of unstapled leaflets that they called Guideposts .
Compared to the big , established magazines , my first efforts seemed feeble indeed .
But from the start they had two important ingredients : sincerity and realism .
The people who told the stories were sincere .
And the stories they told were true .
For example , early in my life , when one of my editorial workers wanted to find out how churches and philanthropic organizations met the needs of New York's down-and-outers , he didn't just ask questions .
Len LeSourd went and lived in the slums as a sidewalk derelict for ten days .
That was nearly 13 years ago .
Len LeSourd is my executive editor today .
Many of you are familiar , I'm sure , with the story of my early struggles : the fire in January , 1947 , that destroyed everything -- even our precious list of subscribers .
The help and sympathy that were forthcoming from everywhere .
The crisis later on when debts seemed about to overwhelm me .
That was when a remarkable woman , Teresa Durlach , came to my aid -- not so much with money , as with wisdom and courage .
`` You're not living up to your own principles '' , she told my discouraged people .
`` You're so preoccupied that you've let your faith grow dim .
What do you want -- a hundred thousand subscribers ? ?
Visualize them , then , believe you are getting them , and you will have them '' ! !
And the 100,000 subscribers became a reality .
And then 500,000 .
And now a million January Guideposts are in circulation .
With our growth came expansion into new fields of service .
Today more than a thousand industries distribute me to their employees .
They say all personnel have spiritual needs which Guideposts helps to meet .
Hundreds of civic clubs , business firms and individuals make me available to school teachers throughout the land .
They say it helps them bring back into schools the spiritual and moral values on which this country was built .
Thousands of free copies are sent each month to chaplains in the Armed Forces , to prison libraries and to hospitals everywhere .
Bedridden people say I am easy to hold -- and read .
Three years ago it became possible to finance a Braille edition for blind readers .
Throughout these exciting years I have been fortunate for , although I have never offered great financial inducements , talent has found its way to me : William Boal who so ably organizes business operations ; ;
John Beach who guides circulation ; ;
Irving Granville and Nelson Rector who travel widely calling on business firms .
Searching for the best in spiritual stories , my roving editors cover not only the country , but the whole world .
Glenn Kittler has been twice to Africa , once spending a week with Dr. Albert Schweitzer .
Last summer John and Elizabeth Sherrill were in Alaska .
Van Varner recently returned from Russia .
Twice a month the editorial staff meets in New York for an early supper , then a long evening of idea-exchange .
Around the table sit Protestant , Catholic , and Jew .
Each contributes something different , and something important : Ruth Peale , her wide experience in church work ; ;
Sidney Fields , years of experience as a New York columnist ; ;
Catherine Marshall LeSourd , the insight that has made her books world-famous and Norm Mullendore , the keen perception of an advertising executive .
There are people who travel long distances to assure my continued existence .
Elaine St. Johns may fly in from the West Coast for the editorial staff meetings .
Starr Jones gets up every morning at five o'clock , milks his family cow , attends to farm chores , and then takes a two-hour train trip to New York .
Arthur Gordon comes once a month all the way from Georgia .
We have also seen the power of faith at work among us .
Rose Weiss , who handles all the prayer-requests that we receive , answering each letter personally , has the serene selflessness that comes from suffering : she has had many major operations , and now gets about in a limited way on braces and crutches .
Recently , John Sherrill was stricken with one of the deadliest forms of cancer .
We prayed for John , during surgery , we asked others to pray ; ;
all over the country a massive shield of prayer was thrown around him .
Today the cancer is gone .
Perhaps it is not fair to mention some people without mentioning all .
But , you see , those who are not mentioned will not resent it .
That is the kind of people they are .
Perhaps you think the editorial meetings are solemn affairs , a little sanctimonious ? ?
Not so .
Serious , yes , but also much laughter .
Sharp division of opinion , too , and strenuous debate .
There are brain-wracking searches for the right word , the best phrase , the most helpful idea .
And there is also something intangible that hovers around the table .
A good word for it is fellowship .
A shorter word is .
Each meeting starts with a prayer , offered spontaneously by one member of the group .
It takes many forms , this prayer , but in essence it is always a request for guidance , for open minds and gentle hearts , for honesty and sincerity , for the wisdom and the insights that will help Guideposts' readers .
For you , readers , are an all-important part of the spiritual experiment that is Guideposts .
I need your support , your criticism , your encouragement , your prayers .
I am a magazine ; ;
my name is Guideposts .
My message , today , is the same as it was 15 years ago : that there is goodness in people , and strength and love in God .
May He bless you all .
Havana was filled with an excitement which you could see in the brightness of men's eyes and hear in the pitch of their voices .
The hated dictator Batista had fled .
Rumors flew from lip to lip that Fidel Castro was on his way to Havana , coming from the mountains where he had fought Batista for five years .
Already the city was filled with Barbudos , the bearded , war-dirty Revolutionaries , carrying carbines , waving to the crowds that lined the Prado .
And then Castro himself did come , bearded , smiling ; ;
yet if you looked closely you'd see that his eyes did not pick up the smile on his lips .
At first I was happy to throw the support of our newspaper behind this man .
I am sure that Castro was happy , too , about that support .
Diario De La Marina was the oldest and most influential paper in Cuba , with a reputation for speaking out against tyranny .
My grandfather had been stoned because of his editorials .
My own earliest memories are of exiles : my three brothers and I were taken often to the United States `` to visit relatives '' while my father stayed on to fight the dictator Machado .
When it was my turn , I , too , printed the truth as I knew it about Batista , and rejoiced to see his regime topple .
None of us was aware that the biggest fight was still ahead .
I was full of hope as Fidel Castro came into Havana .
Within a week , however , I began to suspect that something was wrong .
For Castro was bringing Cuba not freedom , but hatred .
He spent long hours before the TV spitting out promises of revenge .
He showed us how he dealt with his enemies : he executed them before TV cameras .
On home sets children were watching the death throes of men who were shot before the paredon , the firing wall .
Castro's reforms ? ?
He seemed bent on coupling them with vengeance .
New schools were rising , but with this went a harsh proclamation : any academic degree earned during Batista's regime was invalid .
Economic aid ? ?
He had promised cheaper housing : arbitrarily he cut all rents in half , whether the landlord was a millionaire speculator or a widow whose only income was the rental of a spare room .
Under another law , hundreds of farms were seized .
Farm workers had their wages cut almost in half .
Of this , only 50 cents a day was paid in cash , the rest in script usable only in `` People's Stores '' .
A suspicion was growing that Fidel Castro was a Communist .
In my mind , I began to review : his use of hate to gain support ; ;
his People's Courts ; ;
his division of society into two classes , one the hero , the other the villain .
But most disturbing of all were the advisers he called to sit with him in the Palace ; ;
many came from Communist countries .
What should I do about it , I asked myself ? ?
I had watched Castro handling his enemies before the paredon .
There was no doubt in my mind that if I crossed him , mobs would appear outside our windows shouting `` Paredon ! !
Paredon ! !
''
What should I do ? ?
I was proud of the new buildings which housed Diario now : the rotogravures , gleaming behind glass doors ; ;
the thump and whir of our new presses .
Here was a powerful , ready-made medium , but it could speak only if I told it to .
Then one day , early in January , 1960 , I sat down at my desk , and suddenly I was aware of the crucifix .
It was a simple ivory crucifix which my mother had given me .
I had mounted it on velvet and hung it over my desk to remind me always to use the power of the paper in a Christian manner .
Now it seemed almost as if Jesus were looking down at me with sadness in His eyes , saying :
`` You will lose the paper .
You may lose your life .
But do you have any choice '' ? ?
I knew in that moment that I did not have any choice .
From that day on I began to write editorials about the things I did not think correct in Fidel Castro's regime .
Too often a beginning bodybuilder has to do his training secretly either because his parents don't want sonny-boy to `` lift all those old barbell things '' because `` you'll stunt your growth '' or because childish taunts from his schoolmates , like `` Hey lookit Mr. America ; ;
whaddya gonna do with all those muscles ( of which he has none at the time ) '' ? ?
After all , a guy's gotta have a little ego ! !
Therefore it's a genuine pleasure to tell you about an entirely happy bodybuilder who has never had to train in secret has never heard one unkind word from his parents and never has been taunted by his schoolmates ! !
This happy , always smiling lad with the sunny disposition is our new Junior Mr. Canada -- Henri De Courcy .
Far from discouraging Henri , his parents urge him on to greater and greater accomplishments .
Instead of admonishing him to let the weights alone they personally took him to that master Montreal bodybuilding authority , Professor Roland Claude .
And they couldn't have entrusted Henri to better hands because `` le professeur '' knows his muscles from the sterno-cleido mastoideus of the neck right down to the tibialis anticus of the leg and better still , he knows just what exercises work best for them and what Weider principles to combine them with for fast , fast muscle growth .
That's because the good professor teaches only Weider methods at his famous Montreal Health Studio which is located at 1821 Mt. Royal East in Montreal .
Undoubtedly you have read the case histories of some of his prize-winning pupils ( every pupil has a physique title of some kind or other ) .
There's Gaetan D'Amours who is our newest Mr. Canada ; ;
Jean-Paul Senesac , whose story appeared here two issues ago ; ;
Jack Boissoneault , who was with us last month ; ;
Charles Harve , who recently won the `` Most Muscular Man '' subdivision award in the Mr. Canada event ; ;
and a host of others .
Yesiree , the professor knows his muscles ! !
Now when Henri was just 12 he was only 4' 10'' '' tall and weighed an astounding 72 pounds , and his greatest desire was to pack on some weight .
About that time he began reading Mr. America and Muscle Builder and he learned of the famous Weider way to fast weight gaining .
Seeing so many illustrations and reading so many testimonials to the value of Quick-Wate and Super-Protein , those two wonder-working Weider food supplements , he decided to try them and see what they could do for him .
Well , sir they did real great ! !
For in almost less time than it takes to tell it , Henri's bodyweight was increasing rapidly .
Of course he did some exercising .
He's crazy about water skiing and swimming and this vigorous exercise in conjunction with the added food supplements packed pounds of solid muscle on his skinny frame .
Henri has always had shapely legs from swimming and water skiing and really doesn't have to work them very much .
But he was totally dissatisfied with his upper body .
It was muscular but it wasn't symmetrical .
`` A real ' nothing ' torso '' , says Henri .
`` It never seemed to widen .
It just got longer and longer '' .
That's when he went to Professor Claude .
And at once Claude saw what the trouble was and he knew just how to correct it .
In his gym the professor has some of the most `` knocked out '' equipment since Vic Tanny .
Mr. Claude is a specialist in torso development and he has long favored the now-famous Weider Push-Pull Super-Set technique in which one exercise of the Super-Set is a pressing or `` pushing '' movement which accents one sector of a muscle group in a specific way , followed by a `` pulling '' exercise which works the opposing sector of the same muscle group .
So right away Claude introduced Henri to his famous `` moon '' bench and proceeded to teach him his first Push-Pull Super-Set consisting of the wide-grip Straight-Arm Pullover ( the `` pull '' part of the Push-Pull Super-Set ) which dramatically widens the ribcage and strongly affects the muscles of the upper back and chest and the collar-to-collar Bench Press which specifically works on the chest to build those wide , Reeves-type `` gladiator '' pecs , while stimulating the upper lats and frontal deltoids .
As you can see , in this Push-Pull Super Set the entire chest-back-shoulder area is vigorously exercised in alternate sectors by alternate exercises so the complete torso remains pumped-up all the time ! !
Now when Henri has completed four complete Push-Pull Super-Sets No. 1 , the professor allows him about a five-minute rest period before starting him on four complete Push-Pull Super-Sets No. 2 .
Super-Set No. 2 is made up of similar exercises , but this time done with dumbbells , and using both `` moon '' and flat benches .
The `` push '' exercise of this Push-Pull Super-Set is the Bench Press done with elbows well pulled back and with a greater downward stretch of the pectorals not possible with the barbell variation .
You need the barbell variation to build width and mass in the pecs .
The dumbbell variation develops a most classically sculptured outline to the Aj .
The `` pull '' exercise in this Super-Set is the one-dumbbell Bent-Arm Pullover .
( Note how strongly the upper lats and serratus are worked in this fine exercise because of the pin-point concentration of force which the dumbbell variation affords ) .
In the third Push-Pull Super-Set the `` push '' exercise is the widegrip Pushup Between Bars , while the `` pull '' exercise is the Moon Bench Lateral Raise with bent arms .
The Pushup done in this manner is the greatest pectoral-ribcage stretcher ever invented ! !
This is true only if a very wide grip is used and only when the greatest possible stretch is achieved .
You'll know when you've made the greatest stretch because your shoulder blades will touch ! !
As you see , the professor has designed a piece of apparatus that forces the bodybuilder to use a w-i-d-e grip .
He has to ; ;
he just can't do anything about it at all ! !
But as you can also see , it's not a painful exercise at all , because Henri De Courcy -- the `` happy '' bodybuilder -- looks as though he were having the time of his life ! !
The last exercise of Roland Claude's prescribed program for Henri is a single exercise , done in individual sets with a bit longer pause between sets .
By this time Henri's entire chest-back-lat-shoulder area is pumped-up to almost bursting point , and Claude takes time to do a bit more pectoral-front deltoid shaping work .
He has Henri do from four to six sets of the Incline Bench Press ( note the high incline ) .
This gives a wide flare to the pecs , causing them to flow dramatically upward into deltoids and dramatically downward into the serratus and Aj .
This is the kind of chest that invariably wins contests ; ;
that steel-edged `` carved-out-of-solid rock '' looks of the great champions .
So with four complete Push-Pull Super-Sets No. 1 , four of No. 2 , four of No. 3 and four to six sets of the Incline Bench Press , you can see that Henri De Courcy has had a terrific mass-building , muscle-shaping , torso-defining workout that cannot be improved upon .
Physique contests are rarely won on muscle size alone .
Rarer still is a Mr. America or Mr. Universe of true Herculean build .
The aspects of physical development that catch the judges' eyes and which rightfully influence their decisions are symmetry and that hallmark of the true champion -- superior definition of the muscles .
Now good definition is one thing that all of us can acquire with occasional high-set , high-rep , light-weight workouts .
But contest definition -- that dramatic muscular separation of every muscle group that seems as though it must have been carved by a sculptor's chisel -- is something quite different .
This comes not alone from high-set , high-rep training , but from certain definition-specialization exercises which the champion selects for himself with the knowledge of exactly what works best for him .
Often these exercises work well for some bodybuilders but less spectacularly for others .
Because they are `` minority '' exercises and have but a limited appeal they soon find themselves in the limbo of the forgotten .
Only when the newest Mr. America or Mr. Universe discovers them and puts them into practice are we reacquainted with them and once again see how effective they really are .
The exercise I shall discuss in this -- the first of a new series of articles on muscle definition-specialization of a particular body part -- is the One Leg Lunge .
Why it was ever forgotten for even a moment I cannot say because it works perfectly for everyone , no matter whether he has short or long thigh-bone lengths ! !
It is the one exercise that drastically influences the definition of the thighs at the hipline -- that mark of the champion that sets him apart from all other bodybuilders ; ;
a criterion of muscle `` drama '' that is unforgettable to judges and audiences alike ; ;
the facet of muscular development that wins prizes .
Definition of the thighs at the uppermost part is quite commonly seen in most championship Olympic lifters which is easily understandable .
The One Leg Lunge is a split and all lifters practice this in their regular workouts .
But for purely definition purposes -- used in conjunction with your regular Squatting , Leg Curling , Leg Extensor programs -- a heavy weight is not needed .
Indeed , a lighter weight works much better because a greater , more extensive split can be performed .
Used in several sets of high reps once or twice each week it will not be long before your entire upper leg takes on a razor-sharp definition in which the muscles look like wire cables writhing and twisting under the skin ! !
Really there is no reason why this fine exercise should not find its way into your leg program at all times , for the following suggestions show why it is so effective : 1 .
It's a complete thigh contraction-extension exercise .
2 .
It places terrific tension on the leg muscles from start to finish of each repetition .
3 .
It improves over-all balance and control for the bodybuilder , and helps to make Squats more easily and more correctly performed .
4 .
It increases flexibility of the legs .
5 .
It speeds muscle growth and power development even for the advanced bodybuilder because each hip and leg is exercised separately , thus enabling a massive , concentrated effort to be focused on each .
You'll need your Weider Power Stands for this fine exercise and here's the way it's done : 1 .
Place your Power Stands in position and adjust their height so that this will correspond to the height of your shoulders when you are in a deep leg split as for a heavy Clean .
2 .
Place a suitably-loaded barbell across them ; ;
grasp the bar ( which will rest against the back of your neck ) ; ;
extend your feet forward and backward until you are in a deep leg split .
Now raise the weight by straightening your front leg , without moving your feet .
When the front knee is straight and locked , allow it to bend again until you feel the bar come lightly into contact with the sides of the Power Stands .
3 .
After you have taken a breather , reverse the position of your legs so that the front thigh of the previous exercise is now to the rear , and the rear thigh now to the front , and perform the same movement in the same manner .
That's the One-Leg Lunge in a nutshell .
You should have a couple of training partners to stand by when you make your first experiments just for safety .
You should also begin this exercise with a very light barbell until you become accustomed to it balance-wise .
Oh , you'll wobble and weave quite a bit at first .
But don't worry .
Before your first training experiment has ended there will be a big improvement and almost before you know it you'll be raising and lowering yourself just like a veteran ! !
Although I suggested that you hold the bar at the back of the neck there's no reason why you shouldn't make some experiments with the bar held in front of the neck .
Squat-style lifters and leg-split lifters would both benefit enormously by practicing those variations providing that they remember to make alternate sets with the left and right leg to the front .
The most beautiful bed of pansies I've seen was in a South Dakota yard on a sizzling day .
Pansies are supposed to like it cool , but those great velvety flowers were healthy and perky in the glaring sun .
I sought out the gardener and asked him what he did to produce such beauties in that weather .
He seemed puzzled by my question .
`` I just love them '' , he said .
The more I talked with him , the more convinced I became that that was the secret of their riotous blooming .
Of course his love was expressed in intelligent care .
He planted the pansy seeds himself , buying them from a pansy specialist .
These specialists , I learned , have done a great deal of work to improve the size and health of the plants and the resulting flowers .
Their seeds produce vigorous blooming plants half again the size of the unimproved strains .
I asked him if he took seeds from his own plants .
Occasionally , when he had an unusual flower that he wanted more of he did ; ;
but pansy seeds , he told me , soon `` run down '' .
It's best to buy them fresh from a dealer who is working to improve them .
His soil was `` nothing special '' , just prairie land , but he had harrowed in compost until it was loose , spongy and brown-black .
I fingered it and had the feeling of adequacy that comes with the right texture , tilth and body .
It isn't easy to describe it , but every gardener knows it when his fingers touch such soil .
Nothing is easier to grow from seed than pansies .
They germinate quickly , the tiny plants appearing in a week , and grow along lustily .
It doesn't really matter which month of the year you sow them , but they germinate best when they have a wide variation of temperature , very warm followed by cool in the same 24 hours .
I like to make a seedbed right in the open , though many people start them successfully in cold frames .
Pansies don't have to be coddled ; ;
they'd rather have things rugged , with only moderate protection on the coldest days .
If you do use a cold frame be sure that its ventilation is adequate .
For my seedbed I use good garden soil with a little sand added to encourage rooting .
I dig it , rake it smooth , sow the seeds and wet them down with a fog spray .
Then I cover the sowing with a board .
This keeps it cool and moist and protects it from birds .
Ants carry away the seeds so better be sure that there are no ant hills nearby .
When the first sprinkling of green appears I remove the board .
A light , porous mulch applied now keeps the roots cool and the soil soft during these early days of growth .
I like sawdust for this , or hay .
When they have 4 to 6 leaves and are thrifty little plants , it's time to set them out where they are to remain .
Every time you transplant a pansy you cause its flowers to become smaller .
The moral is : don't transplant it any oftener than you must .
As soon as they are large enough to move , I put mine 9 inches apart where they are to bloom .
I put a little scoop of pulverized phosphate rock or steamed bone meal into each hole with the plant .
That encourages rooting , and the better developed the roots , the larger and more plentiful the flowers .
Pansies are gluttons .
I doubt if it is possible to overfeed them .
I spade lots of compost into their bed ; ;
lacking that , decayed manure spread over the bed is fine .
One year I simply set the plants in the remains of a compost pile , to which a little sand had been added , and I had the most beautiful pansies in my , or any of my neighbors' experience .
In addition to the rich soil they benefit by feedings of manure water every other week , diluted to the color of weak tea .
As a substitute for this , organic fertilizer dissolved in water to half the strength in the directions , may be used .
They need mulch .
We put a light mulch over the seedlings ; ;
now we must use a heavy one .
Three inches of porous material will do a good job of keeping weeds down and the soil moist and cool .
When winter comes be ready with additional mulch .
I like hay for this and apply it so that only the tops of the plants show right after a good frost .
That keeps in the cold , retains moisture and prevents the heaving of alternate freezing and thawing .
Don't miss the pansies that appear from time to time through the winter .
Whenever there is a thaw or a few sunny days , you'll be likely to find a brave little blossom or two .
If those aren't enough for you , why not grow some just for winter blooming ? ?
The pansies I cherished most bloomed for me in February during a particularly cold winter .
I started the seed in a flat in June and set out the little pansies in a cold frame .
( An unheated greenhouse would have been better , if I had had one .
) The plants took zero nights in their stride , with nothing but a mat of straw over the glass to protect them .
In response to the lengthening days of February they budded , then bloomed their 4-inch velvety flowers .
That cold frame was my morale builder ; ;
its mass of bright bloom set in a border of snow made my spirits rise every time I looked at it .
Like strawberries in December , pansies are far more exciting in February than in May .
Try that late winter pickup when you are so tired of cold and snow that you feel you just can't take another day of it .
The day will come , in midsummer , when you find your plants becoming `` leggy '' , running to tall-growing foliage at the expense of blossoms .
Try pegging down each separate branch to the earth , using a bobby pin to hold it there .
Pick the flowers , keep the soil dampened , and each of the pegged-down branches will take root and become a little plant and go on blooming for the rest of the season .
As soon as an experimental tug assures you that roots have taken over , cut it off from the mother plant .
A second and also good practice is to shear off the tops , leaving an inch high stub with just a leaf or two on each branch .
These cut-down plants will bud and blossom in record time and will behave just as they did in early spring .
I like to shear half my plants at a time , leaving one half of them to blossom while the second half is getting started on its new round of blooming .
Probably no one needs to tell you that the way to stop all bloom is to let the blossoms go to seed .
Nature's aim , different from ours , is to provide for the coming generation .
That done , her work is accomplished and she ignores the plant .
Here is a word of advice when you go shopping for your pansy seeds .
Go to a reputable grower , preferably a pansy specialist .
It is no harder to raise big , healthy , blooming plants than weak , sickly little things ; ;
in fact it is easier .
But you will never get better flowers than the seed you grow .
Many people think that pansies last only a few weeks , then their period of growth and bloom is over .
That is not true .
If the plants are cared for and protected over the winter , the second year is more prolific than the first .
Would you like to grow exhibition pansies ? ?
Remove about half the branches from each plant , leaving only the strongest with the largest buds .
The flowers will be huge .
Pansies have character .
They stick to their principles , insist upon their due , but grow and bloom with dependable regularity if given it .
Treat them right and they'll make a showing every month in the year except the frigid ones .
Give them food , some shade , mulch , water and more food , and they'll repay your solicitude with beauty .
A salad with greens and tomato is a popular and wonderfully healthful addition to a meal , but add an avocado and you have something really special .
This delightful tropical fruit has become well-known in the past thirty years because modern transportation methods have made it possible to ship avocados anywhere in the United States .
It has a great many assets to recommend it and if you haven't made avocado a part of your diet yet , you really should .
You will find that avocado is unlike any other fruit you have ever tasted .
It is roughly shaped like a large pear , and when properly ripened , its dark green skin covers a meaty , melon-like pulp that has about the consistency of a ripe Bartlett pear , but oily .
The avocado should have a `` give '' to it , as you hold it , when it is ripe .
The flavor is neither sweet , like a pear , nor tart like an orange ; ;
it is subtle and rather bland , nut-like .
It is a flavor that might take a little getting used to -- not because it is unpleasant , but because the flavor is hard to define in the light of our experience with other fruits .
Sometimes it takes several `` eatings '' of avocado to catch that delightful quality in taste that has made it such a favorite throughout the world .
Once you become an avocado fan , you will look forward to the season each year with eager anticipation .
Naturally dormant and no spray danger
Today , refrigerated carriers have made the shipping of avocados possible to any place in the world .
The fruit is allowed to mature on the tree , but it is still firm at this point .
It is brought to packing houses , cleaned and graded as to size and quality , and packed in protective excelsior .
The fruit is then cooled to 42-degrees-F. , a temperature at which it lapses into a sort of dormant state .
This cooling does not change the avocado in any way , it just delays the natural softening of the fruit until a grovelike temperature ( room temperature ) is restored .
This happens on the grocer's shelf or in your kitchen .
One of the most attractive things about avocados is that they do not require processing of any kind .
There is no dyeing or waxing or gassing needed .
If the temperature is controlled properly , the avocado will delay its ripening until needed .
And unlike other fruits , one cannot eat the skin of the avocado .
It is thick , much like an egg plant's skin , so that poison sprays , if they are used , present no hazard to the consumer .
Nutritious and a cholesterol reducer
Good taste and versatility , plus safety from spray poisons would be enough to recommend the frequent use of such a fruit , even if its nutritional values were limited .
Avocados , however , are very rich in nutrients .
Their main asset is an abundance of unsaturated fatty acids , so necessary for maintaining the good health of the circulatory system .
Aside from this , the average portion contains some protein , an appreciable amount of vitamins A and C -- about one-tenth of the minimum daily requirement , and about a third of the official vitamin E requirement .
The B vitamins are well represented , especially thiamin and riboflavin .
Calcium , phosphorus and iron are present in worthwhile amounts , and eleven other minerals also have been found in varying trace amounts .
None of these values is destroyed , not significantly altered by refrigeration storage .
Dr. Wilson C. Grant , of the Veterans' Administration Hospital , Coral Gables , Florida , and the University of Miami School of Medicine , set out to discover if avocados , because of their high content of unsaturated fatty acids , would reduce the cholesterol of the blood in selected patients .
The study comprised 16 male patients , ranging in age from 27 to 72 .
They were put on control diets to determine as accurately as possible , the normal cholesterol level of their blood .
Then they were given 1/2 to 1-1/2 avocados per day as a substitute for part of their dietary fat consumption .
Five , four , three , two , one , fire ! !
The tremendous energy released by giant rocket engines perhaps can be felt much better than it can be heard .
The pulsating vibration of energy clutches at the pit of your stomach .
Never before has the introduction of a weapon caused so much apprehension and fear .
Nuclear weapons are fearsome , but the long-range ballistic missile gives them a stealth and merciless swiftness which is much more terrifying .
A great many writers are bewitched by the apparently overwhelming advantage an attacker would have if he were to strike with complete surprise using nuclear rockets .
It is relatively easy to go a step further and reason that an attacker , in possession of such absolute power , would simultaneously destroy his opponent's cities and people .
With a nation defenseless before it , why would the attacker spare the victim's people ? ?
Wouldn't the wanton destruction of cities and people be the logical act of complete subjugation ? ?
The nation would be utterly devastated .
The will of its people , so crucial in time of peril , would be broken .
Nuclear weapons have given the world the means for self-destruction in hours or days ; ;
and now rockets have given it the means to destroy itself in minutes .
At this point it should be painfully obvious that cities , being `` soft '' , and the people within them are ideally suited to destruction by nuclear weapons .
However , because this vulnerability is mutual , it is to the advantage of neither side to destroy the opponent's cities , at least so long as the opponent has nuclear weapons with which to effect reprisal .
It should be appallingly apparent that city-trading is not a profitable military tactic .
ICBMs have given us a capability which could be used in two different ways .
They could be used to attack a nation's people ( which would inevitably mean the loss of the attacker's own people ) , or they could be used with discrimination to destroy the enemy's military force .
If our national interest lies in being able to fight and win a war rather than committing national suicide , then we must take a much more penetrating look at ballistic missiles .
We must determine whether missiles can win a war all by themselves .
We must make certain that the aircraft is finished before we give the entire job to the missile .
Missiles are very valuable weapons , but they also have their too little known limitations .
Because of a missile's ballistic trajectory , the location of a fixed target must be known quite accurately .
Placing missiles in submarines , on barges , railroads , highways , surface vessels and in the air provides them with passive protection by taking advantage of the gravest weakness of long-range ballistic missiles today -- the extreme difficulty of destroying a mobile or moving target with such weapons .
One must first detect a fleeting mobile or moving target , decide that it is worthy of destruction , select the missile to be fired against the target , compute ballistics for the flight , and prepare the missile for firing .
Even if all these operations could be performed instantaneously , the ICBM still has a time of flight to the target of about 30 minutes .
Therefore , if the target can significantly change its location in something less than 30 minutes , the probability of having destroyed it is drastically lowered .
Because of this , it would appear inevitable that an increasing percentage of strategic missiles will seek self-protection in mobility -- at least until missile defenses are perfected which have an exceedingly high kill probability .
In order to destroy the enemy's mobile , moving , or imprecisely located strategic forces , we must have a hunter-killer capability in addition to our missiles .
Until this hunter-killer operation can be performed by spacecraft , manned aircraft appear to be the only means available to us .
It seems reasonable that if general nuclear war is not to be one cataclysmic act of burning each other's citizens to cinders , we must have a manned strategic force of long-endurance aircraft capable of going into China or Russia to find and destroy their strategic forces which continued to threaten us .
Let us suppose the Russians decide to build a rail-mobile ICBM force .
It is entirely feasible to employ aircraft such as the B-52 or B-70 in hunter-killer operations against Soviet railway-based missiles .
If we stop thinking in terms of tremendous multimegaton nuclear weapons and consider employing much smaller nuclear weapons which may be more appropriate for most important military targets , it would seem that the B-52 or B-70 could carry a great many small nuclear weapons .
An aircraft with a load of small nuclear weapons could very conceivably be given a mission to suppress all trains operating within a specified geographic area of Russia -- provided that we had used some of our ICBMs to degrade Russia's air defenses before our bombers got there .
The aircraft could be used to destroy other mobile , fleeting , and imprecisely located targets as well as the known , fixed and hardened targets which can also be destroyed by missile .
Why , then , aren't we planning a larger , more important role for manned military aircraft ? ?
Is there any other way to do the job ? ?
Survivability of our strategic forces ( Polaris , mobile and hardened Minuteman , hardened Atlas and Titan , and airborne Skybolt ) means that it will take some time , perhaps weeks , to destroy a strategic force .
War , under these circumstances , cannot be one massive exchange of nuclear devastation .
Forces will survive a surprise attack , and these forces will give depth , or considerable duration , to the conflict .
The forces which survive the initial attack must be found and destroyed .
Even mobile forces must be found and destroyed .
But , how does one go about the job of finding and destroying mobile forces ? ?
They are not susceptible to wholesale destruction by ballistic missile .
Some day , many years in the future , true spacecraft will be able to find and destroy mobile targets .
But until we have an effective spacecraft , the answer to the hunter-killer problem is manned aircraft .
However , the aircraft which we have today are tied to large , `` soft '' airfields .
Nuclear rockets can destroy airfields with ease .
Here then is our problem : aircraft are vital to winning a war today because they can perform those missions which a missile is totally incapable of performing ; ;
but the airfield , on which the aircraft is completely dependent , is doomed by the missile .
This makes today's aircraft a one-shot , or one mission , weapon .
Aircraft are mighty expensive if you can use them only once .
This is the point on which so many people have written off the aircraft in favor of the missile .
But remember this -- it isn't the aircraft which is vulnerable to nuclear rockets , it is the airfield .
Eliminate the vulnerability of aircraft on the ground and you have essentially eliminated its vulnerability to long-range ballistic missiles .
There are four rather obvious ways to reduce or eliminate the vulnerability of aircraft on the ground :
Put aircraft in `` bomb-proof '' hangars when they are on the ground .
Build long-range aircraft which can take off from small ( 3,000-foot ) airfields with runways .
If we could use all the small airfields we have in this country , we could disperse our strategic aircraft by a factor of 10 or more .
Use nuclear propulsions to keep our long-range military aircraft in the air for the majority of their useful life .
Using very high thrust-to-weight ratio engines , develop a vertical-takeoff-and-landing ( VTOL ) long-range military aircraft .
We have the technology today with which to build aircraft shelters which could withstand at least 200 Aj .
We could put a portion of our strategic bombers in such shelters .
Large , long-range bombers can be developed which would have the capability to take off from 3,000-foot runways , but they would require more powerful engines than we have today .
There is little enthusiasm for spending money to develop more powerful engines because of the erroneous belief that the aircraft has been made obsolete by the missile .
This same preoccupation with missiles at the expense of aircraft has resulted in our half-hearted effort to develop nuclear propulsion for aircraft .
One seldom hears the analogy `` nuclear propulsion will do for the aircraft what it has already done for the submarine '' .
If , for some reason such as economy , we are not going to develop aircraft nuclear propulsion with a sense of national urgency , then we should turn our effort to developing jet engines with a thrust-to-weight ratio of 12 or 15 to one .
With powerplants such as these , vertical takeoff and landing combat aircraft could be built .
For example , a 12-to-one engine would power a supersonic VTOL fighter .
With a 15-to-one engine , a supersonic aircraft weighing 300,000 pounds could rise vertically .
The reason that we are not going ahead full speed to develop high thrust-to-weight engines is that it would cost perhaps a billion dollars -- and you don't spend that sort of money if aircraft are obsolete .
When aircraft are no longer helpless on airfields , they are no longer vulnerable to Aj .
If our SAC bombers were , today , capable of surviving a surprise missile attack and because of infinite dispersion or long endurance had the capability to strike at Russia again , and again , and again , those bombers would unquestionably assure our military dominance .
We would have the means to seek out and destroy the enemy's force -- whether it were fixed or mobile .
With such a force of manned bombers we could bring enormous pressure to bear on an enemy , and this pressure would be selective and extremely discriminating .
No need to kill an entire city and all its people because we lacked the precision and reconnaissance to selectively disarm the enemy's military force .
Our first necessity , at the very outset of war , is post-attack reconnaissance .
In a few years we will have SAMOS ( semiautomatic missile observation system ) .
But in the case of moving targets , and targets which have limited mobility , what will their location be when it is time to destroy them ? ?
What targets have we successfully knocked out ? ?
A ballistic missile cannot , today , tell you if it was successful or unsuccessful .
What targets still remain to be hit ? ?
These crucial questions must be answered by post-attack reconnaissance .
SAMOS will be hard put to see through clouds -- and to see in the dark .
Even if this is some day possible , there remains the 30-minute time of flight of a missile to its overseas target .
If the target can change its position significantly during the 30 minutes the missile is in the air on its way , the probability of the missile destroying the target is drastically reduced .
Pre-attack reconnaissance is vital but only post-attack reconnaissance will allow us to terminate the war favorably .
It would be priceless to have an aircraft to gather that post-attack reconnaissance .
It could operate under the clouds and perform infrared photography through clouds and at night .
It would be even more valuable because that same aircraft could immediately destroy any targets it discovered -- no need to wait for a missile to come all the way from the United States with the chance that the target , if it were mobile , would be gone .
A large aircraft , such as the B-52 or B-70 , could carry perhaps 50 or 100 small nuclear weapons .
Few people realize that one kiloton of nuclear explosive power will create 1,000 psi overpressure at 100 feet .
Or put another way , the hardest missile site planned today could be destroyed by placing a one-kiloton warhead ( 1/20th the size of those used in Hiroshima and Nagasaki ) within 100 to 200 feet of the target ! !
It is our lack of extreme accuracy which forces the use of very large yield nuclear weapons .
Today we have side-looking radar which has such high resolution that the radar picture clearly shows individual buildings , runways , taxi-ways , separate spans of bridges , etc. .
With these keen `` eyes '' and small nuclear weapons delivered with accuracy , military forces can be directly attacked with minimum damage to urban areas .
If we fail to develop the means to hunt down and destroy the enemy's military force with extreme care and precision , and if war comes in spite of our most ardent desires for peace , our choice of alternatives will be truly frightening .
The lyric beauties of Schubert's Trout Quintet -- its elemental rhythms and infectious melodies -- make it a source of pure pleasure for almost all music listeners .
But for students of musical forms and would-be classifiers , the work presents its problems .
Since it requires only five players , it would seem to fall into the category of chamber music -- yet it calls for a double bass , an instrument generally regarded as symphonic .
Moreover , the piece is written in five movements , rather than the conventional four of most quintets , and this gives the opus a serenade or divertimento flavor .
The many and frequent performances of the Trout serve to emphasize the dual nature of its writing .
Some renditions are of symphonic dimensions , with the contrabass given free rein .
Other interpretations present the music as an essentially intimate creation .
In these readings , the double bass is either kept discreetly in the background , or it is dressed in clown's attire -- the musical equivalent of a bull in a china shop .
Recently I was struck anew by the divergent approaches , when in the course of one afternoon and evening I listened to no fewer than ten different performances .
The occasion for this marathon : Angel's long-awaited reissue in its `` Great Recordings Of The Century '' series of the Schnabel-Pro Arte version .
Let me say at the outset that the music sounded as sparkling on the last playing as it did on the first .
Whether considered alone or in relation to other editions , COLH 40 is a document of prime importance .
Artur Schnabel was one of the greatest Schubert-Beethoven-Mozart players of all time , and any commentary of his on this repertory is valuable .
But Schnabel was a great teacher in addition to being a great performer , and the fact that four of the ten versions I listened to are by Schnabel pupils ( Clifford Curzon , Frank Glazer , Adrian Aeschbacher , and Victor Babin ) also sheds light on the master's pedagogical skills .
Certain pianistic traits are common to all five Schnabelian renditions , most notably the `` Schnabel trill '' ( which differs from the conventional trill in that the two notes are struck simultaneously ) .
But the most impressive testimony to Schnabel's distinction as a teacher is reflected by the individuality which marks each student's approach as distinctly his own .
Schnabel's emphasis on structural clarity , his innate rhythmic vibrancy , and impetuous intensity all tend to stamp his reading as a symphonic one .
Yet no detail was too small to receive attention from this master , and as a result the playing here has humor , delicacy , and radiant humanity .
This is a serious-minded interpretation , but it is never strait-laced .
And although Schnabel's pianism bristles with excitement , it is meticulously faithful to Schubert's dynamic markings and phrase indications .
The piano performance on this Trout is one that really demands a search for superlatives .
About the Pro Arte's contribution I am less happy .
I , for one , rather regret that Schnabel didn't collaborate with the Budapest Quartet , whose rugged , athletic playing was a good deal closer to this pianist's interpretative outlook than the style of the Belgian group .
From a technical standpoint , the string playing is good , but the Pro Arte people fail to enter into the spirit of things here .
The violinist , in particular , is very indulgent with swoops and slides , and his tone is pinched and edgy .
The twenty-five-year-old recording offers rather faded string tone , but the balance between the instruments is good and the transfer is very quiet .
There is a break in continuity just before the fourth variation in the `` Forellen '' movement , and I suspect that this is due to imperfect splicing between sides of the original Aj .
Turning to the more modern versions , Curzon's ( London ) offers the most sophisticated keyboard work .
Every detail in his interpretation has been beautifully thought out , and of these I would especially cite the delicious laendler touch the pianist brings to the fifth variation ( an obvious indication that he is playing with Viennese musicians ) , and the gossamer shading throughout .
Some of Curzon's playing strikes me as finicky , however .
Why , for example , does he favor two tempos , rather than one , for the third movement ? ?
The assisting musicians from the Vienna Octet are somewhat lacking in expertise , but their contribution is rustic and appealing .
( Special compliments to the double bass playing of Johann Krumpp : his scrawny , tottering sound adds a delightful hilarity to the performance .
)
The Glazer-Fine Arts edition ( Concert-Disc ) is a model of lucidity and organization .
It is , moreover , a perfectly integrated ensemble effort .
But having lived with the disc for some time now , I find the performance less exciting than either Schnabel's or Fleisher's ( whose superb performance with the Budapest Quartet has still to be recorded ) and a good deal less filled with humor than Curzon's .
Aeschbacher's work is very much akin to Schnabel's , but the sound on his Decca disc is dated , and you will have a hard time locating a copy of it .
The Hephzibah Menuhin-Amadeus Quartet ( Angel ) and Victor Babin-Festival Quartet ( RCA Victor ) editions give us superlative string playing ( both in symphonic style ) crippled by unimaginative piano playing .
( Babin has acquired some of Schnabel's keyboard manner , but his playing is of limited insight .
) Badura-Skoda-Vienna Konzerthaus ( Westminster ) and Demus-Schubert Quartet ( Deutsche Grammophon ) are both warm-toned , pleasantly lyrical , but rather slack and tensionless .
Helmut Roloff , playing with a group of musicians from the Bayreuth Ensemble , gives a sturdy reading , in much the same vein as that of the last-mentioned pianists .
Telefunken has accorded him beautiful sound , and this bargain-priced disc ( it sells for $2.98 ) is worthy of consideration .
Returning once again to the Schnabel reissue , I am beguiled anew by the magnificence of this pianist's musical penetration .
Here is truly a `` Great Recording of the Century '' , and its greatness is by no means diminished by the fact that it is not quite perfect .
This recording surely belongs in everyone's collection .
Must records always sound like records ? ?
From the beginning of commercial recording , new discs purported to be indistinguishable from The Real Thing have regularly been put in circulation .
Seen in perspective , many of these releases have a genuine claim to be milestones .
Although lacking absolute verisimilitude , they supply the ear and the imagination with all necessary materials for re-creation of the original .
On the basis of what they give us we can know how the young Caruso sang , appreciate the distinctive qualities of Parsifal under Karl Muck's baton , or sense the type of ensemble Toscanini created in his years with the New York Philharmonic .
Since the concept of high fidelity became important some dozen years ago , the claims of technical improvements have multiplied tenfold .
In many cases the revolutionary production has offered no more than sensational effects : the first hearing was fascinating and the second disillusioning as the gap between sound and substance became clearer .
Other innovations with better claims to musical interest survived rehearing to acquire in time the status of classics .
If we return to them today , we have no difficulty spotting their weaknesses but we find them still pleasing .
Records sound like records because they provide a different sort of experience than live music .
This difference is made up of many factors .
Some of them are obvious , such as the fact that we associate recorded and live music with our responses and behavior in different types of environments and social settings .
( Music often sounds best to me when I can dress informally and sit in something more comfortable than a theatre seat .
) From the technical standpoint , records differ from live music to the degree that they fail to convey the true color , texture , complexity , range , intensity , pulse , and pitch of the original .
Any alteration of one of these factors is distortion , although we generally use that word only for effects so pronounced that they can be stated quantitatively on the basis of standard tests .
Yet it is the accumulation of distortion , the fitting together of fractional bits until the total reaches the threshold of our awareness , that makes records sound like records .
The sound may be good ; ;
but if you know The Real Thing , you know that what you are hearing is only a clever imitation .
Command's new Brahms Second is a major effort to make a record that sounds like a real orchestra rather than a copy of one .
Like the recent Scheherazade from London ( High Fidelity , Sept. 1961 ) , it is successful because emphasis has been placed on good musical and engineering practices rather than on creating sensational effects .
Because of this , only those with truly fine equipment will be able to appreciate the exact degree of the engineers' triumph .
The easiest way to describe this release is to say that it reproduces an interesting and effective Steinberg performance with minimal alteration of its musical values .
The engineering as such never obtrudes upon your consciousness .
The effect of the recording is very open and natural , with the frequency emphasis exactly what you would expect from a live performance .
This absence of peaky highs and beefed-up bass not only produces greater fidelity , but it eliminates listener fatigue .
A contributing factor is the perspective , the uniform aesthetic distance which is maintained .
The orchestra is far enough away from you that you miss the bow scrapes , valve clicks , and other noises incidental to playing .
Yet you feel the orchestra is near at hand , and the individual instruments have the same firm presence associated with listening from a good seat in an acoustically perfect hall .
Command has achieved the ideal amount of reverberation .
The music is always allowed the living space needed to attain its full sonority ; ;
yet the hall never intrudes as a quasi-performer .
The timbre remains that of the instruments unclouded by resonance .
All of this would be wasted , of course , if the performance lacked authority and musical distinction .
For me it has more of both elements than the majority of its competitors .
Steinberg seems to have gone directly back to the score , discounting tradition , and has built his performance on the intention to reproduce as faithfully as possible exactly what Brahms set down on paper .
Those accustomed to broader , more romantic statements of the symphony can be expected to react strongly when they hear this one .
Without losing the distinctive undertow of Brahmsian rhythm , the pacing is firm and the over-all performance has a tightly knit quality that makes for maximum cumulative effect .
The Presto Ma non assai of the first trio of the scherzo is taken literally and may shock you , as the real Allegro con Spirito of the finale is likely to bring you to your feet .
In the end , however , the thing about this performance that is most striking is the way it sings .
Steinberg obviously has concluded that it is the lyric element which must dominate in this score , and he manages at times to create the effect of the whole orchestra bursting into song .
The engineering provides exactly the support needed for such a result .
Too many records seem to reduce a work of symphonic complexity to a melody and its accompaniment .
The Command technique invites you to listen to the depth of the orchestration .
Your ear takes you into the ensemble , and you may well become aware of instrumental details which previously were apparent only in the score .
It is this sort of experience that makes the concept of high fidelity of real musical significance for the home music listener .
The first substantially complete stereo Giselle ( and the only one of its scope since Feyer's four-sided LP edition of 1958 for Angel ) , this set is , I'm afraid , likely to provide more horrid fascination than enjoyment .
The already faded pastel charms of the naive music itself vanish entirely in Fistoulari's melodramatic contrasts between ultravehement brute power and chilly , if suave , sentimentality .
And in its engineers' frantic attempts to achieve maximum dynamic impact and earsplitting brilliance , the recording sounds as though it had been `` doctored for super-high fidelity '' .
The home listener is overpowered , all right , but the experience is a far from pleasant one .
As with the penultimate Giselle release ( Wolff's abridgment for RCA Victor ) I find the cleaner , less razor-edged monophonic version , for all its lack of big-stage spaciousness , the more aurally tolerable -- but this may be the result of processing defects in my SD copies .
At the Westminster KC Dog Show in Madison Square Garden , New York on the second day , the Finals of the Junior Class brought out the most competitive competition in the history of this Class .
The Class had entries from as far west as Wisconsin and as far south as Kentucky .
This year several entries from Canada were entered which made the Junior Class International .
Forty-six of the 53 Juniors who mailed in entries were present .
It was interesting to note that many of these Juniors were showing dogs in various other classes at the show prior to the Finals of the Junior Class .
As has been the custom for the past several years , John Cross , Jr. , Bench Show Chmn. of Westminster , arranged for the Juniors' meeting before the Class , and invited two speakers from the dog world to address them .
Over 60 Juniors , parents and guests attended .
Mrs. William H. Long , Jr. speaks
After the Juniors were welcomed and congratulated for qualifying for the Finals of the Junior Class , Mrs. William H. Long , Jr. was introduced as the first speaker .
In her opening remarks Mrs. Long also welcomed the Juniors and stated , `` There isn't any other show quite like Westminster .
I know because this is my 37th year with hardly a break .
Mrs. Long still feels the same unique spirit of Westminster which she stated the present Juniors will experience today but probably will not appreciate in full for a number of years .
Twenty years ago her daughter Betsey Long , then 13 years of age , won the Grand Challenge Trophy , Children's Handling Class ( as they were called then ) at Westminster .
No sooner had Betsey come out of the ring than Mrs. Long walked into the Working Competition with Ch. Cadet or Noranda , another home-bred product , and won ! !
Speaking from long years of experience , Mrs. Long advised the Juniors : `` When showing dogs ceases to be fun and excitement , stop ! !
Dogs have a way of sensing our feelings ! !
When you and your dog step into the Junior ring , it should be just what the dog wants to do as much as what you want him to do .
If you walk into the ring because it is fun to show your dog , he will feel it and give you a good performance ! !
He knows your signals , what is expected of him and the way the Class is conducted , right up through the flash-bulbs of the photographers '' .
Right attitude essential ! !
`` Take away your attitude '' , said Mrs. Long , `` and what have you left ? ?
Either a nervous dog because you are livid with rage -- a sure sign that you are taking things too seriously and had better stop ! !
Or a bored dog because you are more interested in something else -- maybe the way you look , or the date you have after the Class , or you are just doing this to please the parents .
`` The reason you are in the ring today is to show your ability to present to any judge the most attractive picture of your dog that the skillful use of your aids can produce .
Aids sounds more like a Pony Club , or horsemanship classes -- riding a horse and showing a dog are very similar ! !
`` Your aids are your attitude , which comes through your voice , your hands and legs -- voice to encourage , discourage or whatever the need may be ; ;
hands to guide or restrain ; ;
legs to produce motion and rate of speed .
Without right attitude the other aids just do not work right '' .
Mrs. Long wished all the Juniors luck in the Class and stated , `` Have fun ! !
And may you all continue to show at Westminster in the years to come '' ! !
Harvey Barcus , second speaker
The second speaker was Harvey Barcus , President of the Dog Writers Ass'n of America .
Mr. Barcus spoke on the subject of scholarships for Juniors -- with which he is very familiar .
Last year a boy he knows and helped in Journalism won the Thoroughbred Racing Ass'n Scholarship which is worth $10,000 .
He gave a resume of the steps taken in order for the boy he sponsored to win the scholarship .
`` Junior Showmanship is an extremely worthy project and should be earnestly encouraged '' ! !
Is one of Mr. Barcus' strong beliefs .
He feels very forcibly that the American Kennel Club should take a more active part in encouraging the Junior Division ! !
In closing , Mr. Barcus also wished all the Juniors luck in their Class .
Westminster Show Notes
Instead of 3 a.m. in the past , the Juniors Class at Westminster was held at 4:45 p.m. .
This gave the Juniors the use of the entire ring at the show -- a great advantage to them ! !
Before the Juniors entered the ring the Steward announced that after all Juniors had moved their dogs around the ring and set them up , they could relax with their dogs .
From there on , each Junior was going to be judged individually .
This thoughtful gesture was well received by the Juniors as the Class had an entry of 46 Juniors and it took approximately one hour , 45 minutes to judge the Class .
Anne Hone Rogers judges 28th finals
This year Anne Hone Rogers , outstanding Handler , judged the Class .
This is the third time in 28 years of Junior Showmanship at Westminster that a lady Handler has judged the Class .
As the Juniors entered the ring , Mr. Spring , the announcer , stated over the public-address system that this was the 28th year that Westminster has held the Finals of the Junior Competition .
Juniors competed last year at American Kennel Club and Canadian Kennel Club , recognized shows to be eligible to compete in this Class -- the Finals for the year .
A Junior who won two or more wins in the Open Class was eligible .
( The purpose of the Junior Showmanship Competition is to teach and encourage Juniors to become good sportsmen .
Many adults showing at Westminster today are products of this Class .
)
It seemed an almost impossible job for Miss Rogers to select 4 winners from the 46 Juniors entered .
A large number of these Juniors have 7 and 8 wins to their credit and are seasoned campaigners .
After the judge moved all the dogs individually , she selected several from the group and placed them in the center of the ring .
She then went over them thoroughly giving each a strenuous test in showmanship .
International Champion of the year
Betty Lou Ham , age 16 , Holyoke , Mass. , showing an Irish Setter , was chosen as International Champion of the year .
She was awarded the Professional Handlers' Ass'ns' Leonard Brumby , Sr. Memorial Trophy ( named for the founder-originator of the Junior Classes .
)
Betty is 16 years of age and had several wins to her credit last year .
In addition to showing an Irish Setter throughout the year , she also scored with an Afghan .
Other winners
Sydney Le Blanc , age 15 , Staten Island , N.Y. , showing a Doberman Pinscher , was 2nd .
Susan Hackmann , age 14 , from Baltimore , Md. , showing a Dachshund , was 3rd .
Last year Susan also placed 3rd in the Finals at Westminster .
From the records we keep -- Susan is the only Junior who has placed in the Junior Classes in both United States and Canada .
Karen Marcmann , age 16 , Trapp , Penna. , showing a Keeshond was 4th .
Most Juniors who were entered in the Finals are seasoned campaigners and not only show and win in Junior Classes but score in the Breed Classes as well .
Entries increasing -- requirements raised
In 1960 , there were 7287 entries in the Junior Classes .
Each year these shows have increased in entries .
Next year 1962 , at Westminster , the Bench Show Committee has raised the requirements so that a junior must win 3 or more Junior Classes in the open division only to qualify for Westminster .
Percy Roberts , a leading judge will not be at the International Show this year for the Junior Judging Contest as he has been invited to judge in Australia in March .
Judging class for intermediates proposed
It has been suggested many times that a Class be set up for the Juniors who are overage and cannot enter the Junior Classes .
For some time this writer has been suggesting a Junior Judging Class for Intermediates over 16 and under 20 years of age who are ineligible to compete in the Junior Class .
Such a Class was tried out successfully at the Westchester KC Show recently .
Not only were the contestants pleased with the Class , but it aroused the interest of all in attendance that day .
The Intermediates in the Class with the Judge were asked to pick 4 winners and give their reasons but their decisions did not affect the choice of the Judge .
We suggested this Class in the horse world and it was accepted immediately and included in the programs of horse shows .
At the recent horse show convention in New York it was stated that this Intermediate Judging Class is meeting with great success and will be a great help to future judges in the horse world .
This Class can be just as successful in the dog world if it is given a chance .
Last year Robert Harris , a leading Junior Handler entered the Dog Judging Contest ( Junior ) at the International KC of Chicago show and had the highest score in judging of any Junior since the Class' inception .
Juniors who attend this Chicago show should make a point to enter this Class as it would be of great help to them .
More volunteer handlers needed to judge
Superintendents at dog shows state it is becoming more difficult to obtain a licensed Handler to Judge Junior Showmanship Competition .
The founder of the Junior Showmanship Competition the late Leonard Brumby , Sr. ( for whom the trophy is named after at Westminster ) was an outstanding Handler and believed a Junior should have an opportunity to exhibit in a dog show starting with the Junior Showmanship Division .
Some years ago this Class was judged by celebrities who knew nothing of what was required of a Junior's ability to show a dog .
To overcome this unfair judging , the A.K.C. requires that a licensed Handler be present to judge the Class .
If the superintendents do not receive more cooperation from Handlers , it has been suggested that licensed Judges also be qualified to judge this Class .
By recognizing and helping Juniors get interested in the dog world , all will be helping to create future dog owners .
Other awards for Juniors
The Airedale Terrier Club of America and the Kerry Blue Terrier Club of America have under consideration donating trophies to the boys or girls who win with their breeds in Junior Showmanship Competition at any Show .
The Kansas City and the Topeka KCs are arranging that Juniors who win at their shows will be qualified to win points for Westminster .
The Rio Grande KC is also considering having their Junior Classes set up so that Juniors can qualify with points for Westminster .
The American Pointer Club is still continuing to donate trophies to Juniors who win at Junior Showmanship Classes with Pointers .
Traveling through the South -- over 16,000 miles -- with two Great Danes , an Afghan , and a Persian kitten , we've worked up a regular routine for acceptance at motels .
My husband enters the motel office , signs up for a room , and then solemnly asks the proprieter if he accepts pets .
`` Puppies '' ? ?
Comes the suspicious question .
`` No '' , he replies , `` full grown , adult show dogs , housebroken , and obedience-trained '' .
We've never been refused ! !
Once settled , we're careful to walk the dogs in an out of the way spot , keep them under control in the room , and feed and bench them where they can't do any harm to the furnishings or the furniture .
In the morning we leave the room looking as neat as a pin ! !
Many a motel owner -- when we've stopped there again -- has remembered us and has said he preferred our dogs to most children .
So many times I have wondered why veterinarians do not wipe the table clean before each new canine patient is placed on it for examination .
Is it that they don't care ? ?
Are they indifferent to the fact that the dog can easily pick up germs from the preceding patient ? ?
At one time , to most Americans , unless they were fortunate enough to live near a body of navigable water , boats were considered the sole concern of fishermen , rich people , and the United States Navy .
Today the recreational boating scene is awash with heartening statistics which prove the enormous growth of that sport .
There are more than 8,000,000 recreational boats in use in the United States with almost 10,000,000 the prediction for within the next decade .
About 40,000,000 people participated in boating in 1960 .
Boating has become a giant whose strides cover the entire nation from sea to shining sea .
Boats are operated in every state in the Union , with the heaviest concentrations along both coasts and in the Middle West .
The spectacular upsurge in pleasure boating is markedly evident , expectedly , in the areas where boats have always been found : the natural lakes , rivers , and along the nation's coastline .
But during the last several years boats were launched in areas where , a short time ago , the only water to be found was in wells and watering troughs for livestock .
Developed as a result of the multi-purpose resources control program of the government , vast , man-made bodies of water represent a kind of glorious fringe benefit , providing boating and fishing havens all over the country .
No matter how determined or wealthy boating lovers of the Southwest had been , for example , they could never have created anything approaching the fifty square-mile Lake Texoma , located between Texas and Oklahoma , which resulted when the Corp of Army Engineers dammed the Red River .
In 1959 , according to the Engineers , Lake Texoma was only one of thirty-two artificial lakes and reservoirs which were used for recreation by over 1,000,000 persons .
Where an opportunity to enjoy boating has not been created by bringing bodies of water to the people , means have been found to take the people and their boats to the water .
Providing these means are about ninety companies which manufactured the estimated 1,800,000 boat trailers now in use .
It is a simple task to haul a boat fifty or one hundred miles to a lake or reservoir on the new , light , strong , easy-to-operate trailers which are built to accommodate almost any kind of small boat and retail from $100 to $2,000 .
The sight of sleek inboards , outboards , and sailboats being wheeled smartly along highways many miles from any water is commonplace .
Boatmen lucky enough to have facilities for year-'round anchorage for their craft , will recall the tedious procedure of loading their gear into the car , driving to the water , and making trip after trip to transfer the gear to the boat .
Today , the boat , on its trailer , is brought to the gear and loaded at the door .
Arriving at the waterside , the boat is launched , the family taken aboard and , that easily , another day afloat is begun .
And trailers for boats are not what they started out to be ten years ago .
This year , Americans will discover previously unheard of refinements in trailers that will be exhibited in about one hundred of our nation's national , regional and local boat shows .
The boats of America's trailer sailors in 1961 will be coddled on clouds as they are hauled to new horizons .
The variety of craft on the country's waters today is overwhelming .
They range from an eight-foot pram , which you can build yourself for less than $50 , to auxiliary sailboats which can cost over $100,000 .
Boat prices vary according to the buyer's desires or needs .
In this respect , boats can be compared with houses .
There is no limit to what you can spend , yet it is easily possible to keep within a set budget .
There is no question as to just what is available .
You name it , our industry is producing it , and it probably is made in different models .
There are canoes ideal for fishing in protected waters or for camping trips .
There are houseboats which are literally homes afloat , accommodating whole families in comfort and convenience .
You can cross an ocean in a fully equipped craft , sail , power , or both , or laze away a fine day in a small dinghy on a local pond .
You may have your boat of wood , canvas , plywood , plastic , or metal .
You may order utility models , inboard or outboard , with or without toilets , galleys , and bunks .
You may dress it up with any number of accessories or keep it as simple as you choose .
Designers and manufacturers have produced models for purchasers who run the gamut from a nautical version of the elderly Pasadena lady who never drove more than five miles an hour on her once-a-month ride around the block , to the sportiest boatman who insists on all the dash , color , flair and speed possible to encompass in a single boat .
You pay your money and you take your choice .
American technology in engine and hull design is largely responsible for the plentiful interest in American boating .
I wonder if anyone ever bothered to make the point that when it comes to boats and their motors , Americans excel over any country in the world in the long run .
Russia , whose technology is not quite primitive , is still in the dark ages when it comes to improving the outboard motor , for instance .
Now here is truly a marvel .
The outboard engine of today has a phenomenal range of one to 80 horsepower , unheard of a few years ago for a two cycle engine in quantity production .
These engines can be removed from a boat with relative ease , wherein lies their greatest advantage .
Their cost is not beyond the hopes of the American pocketbook , the range being about $150 to $1,000 , depending on size .
Great thought has been given to making life easier for the growing boating population of the country ; ;
and to making the owning of a boat simpler .
There was a time when , if a man wanted to purchase a boat , it was necessary for him to be able to produce a sizeable amount of cash before he could touch the tiller or wheel .
Having a boat financed through a local bank is done much the same way as an automobile loan is extended .
Marine dealers and even some manufacturers who sell direct in non-dealer areas cooperate in enabling you to launch now and pay later .
Terms range from one to five years and the interest rates and down payments run about the same as for automobiles .
Of course , individual financing arrangements depend a good deal on the purchaser's earning power , credit rating and local bank policy .
Outboard motors , insurance , and boat repairs may also be financed in the same way as boats .
Terms and rates of interest for motors generally follow those for home appliances .
When the automobile was in its embryonic stage , such roads as existed were pretty much open roads with the tacit understanding that horses should not be unduly terrified being about the only rule governing where , when and how fast a car could go .
When air travel was in its infancy , the sky was considered big enough and high enough for all .
Man had enough to worry about managing to get up there and stay without being burdened with rules once aloft .
It was much the same with pleasure boating at first .
Come one , come all , the water's fine ! !
As the ungoverned days of the automobile and the airplane are long since relegated to the past , so is the carefree attitude toward what a boatman may and may not do ; ;
must and should do .
However , there is a minimum of legislative restriction on boating .
Laws on boating vary according to the state in which the craft is to be used and according to its horsepower .
What may be acceptable in one state may be strictly prohibited across the boundary line .
The main requirement is to be sure the boat is numbered according to the regulations of the state in which the boat will be principally used .
If your state has no provisions for the numbering of pleasure boats , you must apply for a number from the U.S. Coast Guard for any kind of boat with mechanical propulsion rated at more than 10 horsepower before it can be used on Federal waterways .
State numbering laws differ from each other in many ways .
Fees are not the same and some states do not require certain craft , such as sailboats with no power , to be registered at all .
Many states have laws regulating the use of boat trailers and some have restrictions regarding the age of motor boat operators .
Generally , states reserve for communities the right to have local ordinances regulating speed and other activities .
It is always wise to consult your marine dealer , local yacht or boat club secretary , or local law enforcement officers if you are not positive what the regulations are .
Ignorance of the law is no better excuse on the water than it is on land ; ;
lack of ability and common sense can lead to just as much tragedy .
Hand in hand with the legislative program is the industry's self originated and directed safety program .
Foreseeing the possible threats to safety with the rapid growth of the sport , the industry has been supporting an intense , coordinated educational program with great success since 1947 .
A primary factor in the success of the safety program has been the enthusiastic cooperation of the individual manufacturers .
The industry has been its own watch dog .
With U.S. Coast Guard cooperation , the American Boat and Yacht Council was formed to develop recommended practices and standards for boats and their equipment with reference to safety .
Industry interest in safety goes even farther .
In 1959 , the Yacht Safety Bureau was reorganized by the National Association of Engine and Boat Manufacturers and a group of insurance underwriters to provide a testing laboratory and labeling service for boats and their equipment .
A new waterfront site for the bureau is now being built at Atlantic City , New Jersey , to provide the most modern marine testing facilities as a further tool to keep the sport safe .
In addition to these activities , the NAEBM , with headquarters at 420 Lexington Avenue , New York City , as well as other associations and individual manufacturers , provide and distribute films , booklets , and public services in regard to proper boat handling and safety afloat .
It is important to note the work of the United States Power Squadrons and the U.S. Coast Guard Auxiliary .
Each of these fine groups gives free boating classes in seamanship piloting and small boat handling .
These are not governmentally subsidized organizations .
This year , over 100,000 persons will receive this free instruction .
As America on wheels was responsible for an industry of motor courts , motels , and drive-in establishments where you can dine , see a movie , shop , or make a bank deposit , the ever-increasing number of boating enthusiasts have sparked industries designed especially to accommodate them .
Instead of motels , for the boatman there are marinas .
The word marina was coined by NAEBM originally to describe a waterfront facility where recreational boats could find protection and basic needs to lay over in relative comfort .
Currently , marina is used to indicate a municipal or commercially operated facility where a pleasure boat may dock and find some or all of the following available : gasoline , fresh water , electricity , telephone service , ice , repair facilities , restaurants , sleeping accommodations , a general store , and a grocery store .
Yachtel , a relatively new word , indicates a waterfront type of hotel where a yachtsman may dock and find overnight accommodations on the premises as well as other services .
Boatel has a similar meaning to yachtel .
It indicates the same thing but it is meant to pertain more specifically to establishments designed to cater to smaller type boats such as outboards .
Regardless of nomenclature , yachtels and boatels are marinas .
Boatyards which also provide some of the above facilities may rightfully be called marinas .
A recent survey disclosed there are about 4,000 commercially and municipally operated marinas and boatyards in the United States , the majority of which are equipped to handle outboard boats .
The design of a mechanical interlocking frame is much like a mechanical puzzle , but once understood , the principles can be applied to any track and signal arrangement .
In the frame are two sets of bars which interact with each other to prevent the operator from making dangerous moves .
The main set of bars are the `` tappets '' and one tappet is connected to each lever .
If the lever is pulled to clear a signal or move a switch , the tappet moves a short distance lengthwise at the same time .
Close behind the plane of the tappets are the locking bars .
These can also move a short distance but at right angles to the tappets .
The number of locking bars required depends on how many false moves must be prevented .
In the sides of the tappets are notches with sloping sides , and connection between the tappets and locking bars consist of cams called `` dogs '' .
Two or more dogs are mounted on each locking bar .
These slide into and out of the notches in the tappets as the tappets are moved , locking and unlocking them .
Here's how the scheme works : Suppose the operator pulls the lever to clear a particular signal .
This also pulls the tappet connected to the particular lever and forces any dogs seated in the notches to the side , thus moving one or more locking bars .
The dogs on the other ends of these locking bars are thus forced into notches in other tappets .
By this scheme , pulling one signal to clear locks all the other switch and signal levers in safe positions until the first signal is again restored to normal .
Interlocking signals are normally at stop or `` red '' position , and a lever must be pulled to `` clear '' the signal .
This is not necessarily to green , however , for in some situations only a yellow indication is given to a train to let it into the `` plant '' .
There are other basic rules .
A turnout may have two levers , one to actually move the switch points , the other to lock the points .
A signal cannot be cleared until all the related turnouts are properly thrown and locked .
Such locks are nearly always used where the switch points `` face '' oncoming traffic .
The lock insures that the points are thrown all the way with no chance that a wheel flange will snag on a partly thrown point .
If the points aren't thrown all the way , the Turnout cannot be locked , and in turn , the signal cannot be cleared .
Generally , these locks on turnouts are called `` facing point locks '' .
Figs. 1-6 show typical arrangements of track and signals .
Each diagram is accompanied by a `` dog chart '' , a list of the levers that show which other levers any particular lever will lock if pulled .
The lines connecting the wedge-shaped dogs represent the locking bars at right angles to the tappet bars .
By studying the track-signal diagrams you'll note several other details .
Derails -- mechanical track devices that actually guide the wheels off the rails if a train passes a `` stop '' signal -- are used in many instances .
`` Home '' signals have two blades .
The blacked-in blades indicate a fixed aspect -- the blade does not move .
As an engineer approaches the plant the position of the home signal is seen in advance when he passes the `` distant '' signal located beyond the limits of the interlocking plant .
In some low-speed situations , the distant signal is fixed at caution .
In other instances where there is no automatic block signaling , the distant has only green and yellow aspects .
So much for the prototype .
The interlocking frame we built at the model railroader workshop and then installed on Paul Larson's railroad follows the Fig. 1 scheme and is shown beginning in Fig. 7 , page 65 , and in the photos .
Here's how it can be built .
Frame
The sizes of pieces needed for the interlocking frame are shown in the notes within Fig. 7 , most of the bars being 1/8'' '' brass in 1/4'' '' and 1/2'' '' widths .
You may change the dimensions to suit a frame for more or fewer levers and locks as you wish .
Our instructions assume you are building this particular frame , which is for a junction .
When cutting the pieces , dress the ends smooth , and square with a smooth file or sanding disk .
Start with the right-hand piece `` B '' , Af , soldering it to the lower piece `` A '' of the same material but 12'' '' long .
Let exactly 1'' '' of `` A '' extend beyond `` B '' and use a square to check your angle to exactly 90 degrees .
Now lay 12 pieces of Af cut 5-3/4'' '' long side by side but separated by 12 pieces of the same material 1/2'' '' sq. .
This gives you the spacing for locating the left-hand piece `` B '' .
Compress the assembly when you make the mark to show the location for `` B '' .
Solder this second `` B '' to `` A '' at right angles .
There should be 10'' '' between the two parallel members and each should be 1'' '' from an end of the long piece .
Cap this assembly ( with spacing bars in place ) with a Af bar .
Tack-solder all the 1/2'' '' sq. pieces to the 10'' '' and 12'' '' members .
These will be drilled and tapped later on .
Now cut five Af locking bar spacers ( which run horizontally ) .
Position these using six intermediate temporary Af spacers and locate the upper 12'' '' bar `` A '' .
Solder it and the five locking bar spacers to the frame .
Now place 12 pieces 1/2'' '' sq. on this edge as we did before and space them with the 5-3/4'' '' long `` tappets '' , as they are called .
Cap with a Af bar and tack-solder in place .
Cap the locking bar spacers with two Af directly under the first two `` B '' pieces .
Remove all the loose spacing bars .
Mark and center-punch all the holes required for screws to hold this assembly together .
See Fig. 7 .
Placement of these holes is not critical , but they should be located so that the centers are about 1/8'' '' from any edge .
Drill all No. 50 and counter-drill all except the `` A '' pieces size 43 .
Tap the `` A '' pieces 2-56 .
Now unsolder and disassemble the frame except for the two 12'' '' and the first two 3-3/4'' '' bars ( `` A '' and `` B '' pieces ) , which are soldered together .
Either lay the components aside in proper order or code them with numbers and letters so they may be replaced in their proper positions .
Dress all surfaces with a file , cleaning off all solder and drilling burrs .
Drill 20 No. 47 holes in the upper piece `` A '' as shown in Fig. 7 .
Tap these 3-48 for mounting the electrical contact later on .
Note , 6 and 8 lock levers don't require holes for contacts .
Now reassemble the frame , using Af roundhead steel screws and nuts .
Put the 12 tappets and some Af locking bar spacers in the frame to help align all the components before you tighten the screws .
Be sure the tappets are not pinched by a twisted 1/2'' '' sq. spacer .
As an anchor for the spring lock , insert a Af bar in the lower left corner of the frame as shown in Fig. 7 .
Drill a No. 43 hole through the pieces and secure with a 2-56 nut and screw .
Drill two No. 50 holes , one in the insert and one in the locking bar spacer directly above it , and tap 2-56 .
Number all the tappet bars before removing them so they can be replaced in the same slots .
Remove all other loose pieces and file the edges of the basic frame smooth .
Cut five pieces of Af brass bar stock 3-3/4'' '' long .
These are supporting members for the short locking bars .
Locate their positions in Fig. 7 and drill No. 43 to match the corresponding holes in the frame .
Cut off excess screw lengths and file flush with either frame or nut .
Drill four No. 19 and four No. 28 holes in the 12'' '' long `` A '' pieces .
Locate the position from Fig. 7 .
Tappets and locking bars
Draw-file No. 1 tappet to a smooth fit in its respective slot and square the ends .
Break the end corners with a slight 45 degree chamfer .
Drill a No. 50 hole 1-1/4'' '' from one end and tap 2-56 .
( See Fig. 7 .
) Put a 2-56 roundhead screw into the hole , cut off the excess threads and file flush with the underside of the bar .
To find the other stop screw position , insert the tappet into the frame and hold the screw head tight against the frame edge .
Scribe a line across the bar on the other end of the tappet , 1/4'' '' plus half the diameter of the 2-56 screw head ( about 5/64'' '' ) away from the frame edge .
Total distance is about 21/64'' '' .
Tend to make this dimension slightly undersize so you can file the screw head to get exactly 1/4'' '' tappet movement .
Drill a No. 50 hole , tap 2-56 and insert a roundhead 2-56 screw as you did on the first end .
Drill a No. 47 hole crosswise through the tappet at the position shown in Figs. 7 and 8 .
Repeat these drill and tap operations for each of the tappet bars .
To each tappet except 6 and 8 , solder a Af piece of brass and file to the tapered shape shown in Figs. 6 and 8 .
These will serve as lifting pads for the electrical contacts .
Fitting the locking bars and making the locking pieces is a rather tedious job since stop screws , tappets and locking bars must be removed and replaced many times .
As the work progresses the frame and moving parts become a sort of Chinese puzzle where several pieces must be removed before the part you are working on is accessible .
A little extra work here will pay off with a smooth , snug-fitting machine when you are finished .
Each completed locking bar should remain in place as the work progresses to insure snug fitting .
The order of fitting is not too important .
However , we started with the first row of bars and worked our way back .
Since the same method of shaping and fitting the dogs and notches is used throughout , we will only describe the construction of one locking bar .
Figs. 7 and 8 give all pertinent dimensions .
All the bars are cut from Af brass .
The lengths of each piece are listed at the bottom of Fig. 7 .
Bar `` C '' is 2-3/4'' '' long .
Draw-file the edges , square up the ends and put a slight chamfer on the edges so they will not snag in the frame .
Fig. 8 gives the dimensions for locating the dog-pin holes .
Center-punch and drill the No. 31 hole 7/16'' '' from one end of the bar .
Chuck a length of 1/8'' '' dia. drill rod into a drill press or some similar turning device and while it is rotating file the end square and then file a slight taper 1/8'' '' long .
Cut the piece about 9/32'' '' or 5/16'' '' long and drive it into the No. 31 hole drilled in the locking bar .
File the bottom edge flush with the bar and the top 1/8'' '' above the bar .
This dog will engage a notch to be cut in tappet 3 .
Place the locking bar in proper position and insert tappet 3 .
Scribe a line through the center of the pin and across the face of tappet 3 , parallel to piece `` A '' .
See the drawings for the shape of the notch .
Scribe V-shaped lines on the bar and rough out with either a hack saw or a cutting disk in a hand power tool .
We used the latter equipped with a carborundum disk about
'' thick and 1'' '' dia. fitted on a 1/8'' '' dia. mandrel .
Such disks are very handy for cutting and shaping small parts .
File to a smooth finish .
A Barrette Swiss pattern file is handy since its triangular shape with only one cutting face will allow you to work a surface without marring an adjoining one .
Endeavor to get the notches as much alike as possible .
The notch should have a smooth finish so that the steel dog will slide easily over it .
Assemble the parts in the frame and test the sliding action of the mating pieces .
All matching surfaces should be checked frequently and mated on a cut and fit basis .
Chuck a 2'' '' or 3'' '' piece of 1/8'' '' dia. drill rod in a drill press or electric hand tool .
Fashion a sharp scribing point about 3/64'' '' long on one end , using Swiss pattern files .
This tool can also be made with a lathe .
Scientists say that the world and everything in it are based on mathematics .
Without math the men who are continually seeking the causes of and the reasons for the many things that make the world go 'round would not have any means of analyzing , standardizing , and communicating the things they discover and learn .
Math and the formulas that allow it to be applied to different problems are , therefore , essential to any scientific endeavor .
Hot rodding is a science .
It's not a science as involved as determining what makes the earth rotate on its axis or building a rocket or putting a satellite into orbit but it is , nevertheless , a science .
But because science is based on mathematics doesn't mean that a hot rodder must necessarily be a mathematician .
A guy can be an active and successful hot rodder for years without becoming even remotely involved with mathematical problems ; ;
however , he will have a clearer understanding of what he is doing and the chances are he will be more successful if he understands the few formulas that apply to rodding .
A mathematical formula is nothing more than a pattern for solving a specific problem .
It places the various factors involved in the problem in their correct order in relation to each other so that the influence of factors on each other can be computed .
The first step in using a formula is to insert the numerical values of the factors involved in their correct positions in the formula .
This changes the formula to an `` equation '' .
The equation is used for the mathematical process of solving the problem .
Equations for rodding formulas are not complicated .
They involve only simple mathematics that are taught in grammar school arithmetic classes .
However , it is essential that the various mathematical symbols used in the equations be understood so that the mathematical processes can be done properly and in their correct order .
They indicate simple division , multiplication , subtraction , and addition .
The symbol for division is a straight line that separates two numbers placed one above the other .
The lower number is always divided into the upper number : Af
.
The symbol for multiplication is `` **b '' .
It is used to separate two or more numbers in a row .
For example : Af .
Numbers to be multiplied together may be multiplied in any order .
The result will be the same regardless of the order used .
The symbol for subtraction is the standard minus sign .
This is nothing more than a dash .
It separates two or more numbers .
The number on the right of the symbol is always subtracted from the number on the left of the symbol .
For example : Af .
When more than two figures are separated by subtraction symbols the subtraction must be carried out from the left to right if the result is to be correct .
For example , for the problem Af , 10 from 25 equals 15 , then 6 from 15 equals 9 .
Addition is indicated by the + symbol .
The symbol is used to separate two or more numbers .
For example : Af .
Numbers separated by addition symbols may be placed in any order .
When solving an equation that involves division as well as other steps , do all the division steps first to reduce those parts of the equation to their numerical value .
Multiplication , subtraction , and addition can then be accomplished as they appear in the equation by starting at the left end of the equation and working toward the right .
Completing the division first also includes those division parts that require multiplication , subtraction , or addition steps : Af .
This would be reduced by multiplying 8 times 6 and then dividing the product by 12 .
This part of the equation would then become 4 .
For use in formulas , fractions should be converted to their decimal equivalents .
The easiest way to do this is with a conversion chart .
Charts for this purpose are available from many sources .
They are included in all types of mathematical handbooks and they are stamped on some types of precision measuring instruments .
The various mathematical processes can be simplified by carrying the results to only two or three decimal places .
Shortening the results in this manner will not have any detrimental effect on the accuracy of the final result .
Some formulas contain `` constants '' .
A constant is a number that remains the same regardless of the other numbers used in the formula and the resultant equation .
It is a number without which the equation cannot be solved correctly .
Rodding formulas apply to many phases of the sport .
The answers they give can often pave the way to performance increases and , quite often , are necessary for completing entry blanks for different events .
When it is needed , one formula is as important as another .
However , some formulas are used more than others .
We'll take them in the general order of their popularity .
Engine displacement
A rodder should be able to compute the displacement of his engine .
Displacement is sometimes referred to as `` swept volume '' .
Most entry blanks for competitive events require engine displacement information because of class restrictions .
It is good to be able to compute displacement so that changes in it resulting from boring and stroking can be computed .
Factors involved in the displacement formula are the bore diameter of the engine's cylinders , the length of the piston stroke , the number of cylinders in the engine , and a constant .
The constant is , which is one-quarter of 3.1416 , another constant known as `` pi '' .
Pi is used in formulas concerned with the dimensions of circles .
Actually , the engine displacement formula is the standard formula for computing the volume of a cylinder of any type with an added factor that represents the number of cylinders in the engine .
The cross-sectional area of the cylinders is determined and then the volume of the individual cylinders is computed by multiplying the area by the stroke length , which is the equivalent of the length of the cylinders .
Multiplying the result by the number of cylinders in the engine gives the engine's total displacement .
The formula is : Af .
Dimensions in inches , and fractions of inches will give the displacement in cubic inches .
Dimensions in centimeters and fractions of centimeters will give the displacement in cubic centimeters ( cc. ) .
One inch equals 2.54 centimeters : one cubic inch equals 16.38 cubic centimeters .
For example , let's consider a standard 283 cubic inch Chevy Aj .
These engines have a cylinder diameter of 3-7/8 inches and a stroke length of 3 inches .
The formula , with the fractions converted to decimals , becomes Af .
To arrive at the answer , multiply the numbers together by starting at the left of the group and working to the right .
The different steps will look like this : Af
.
Compression ratio
A cylinder's compression ratio is computed by comparing the cylinder's volume , or its displacement , with the total volume of the cylinder and its combustion chamber .
Cylinder volume can be determined mathematically but combustion chamber volume must be measured with a liquid .
Cylinder volume is determined in exactly the same manner as for the displacement formula : Af .
To measure the volume of one of the combustion chambers in the cylinder head , install the valves and spark plug in the chamber and support the head so that its gasket surface is level .
Then pour water or light oil from a graduated beaker into the chamber to fill the chamber to its gasket surface .
Do not overfill the chamber .
This is possible with water and other liquids that have a high surface tension .
Such liquids will rise to a considerable height above the surface around the chamber before they will flow out of the chamber .
The amount of liquid poured into the chamber is determined by subtracting the quantity still in the beaker when the chamber is full from the original quantity .
Most beakers are graduated in cubic centimeters ( cc. ) , making it necessary to convert the result to cubic inches .
However , the displacement of the cylinder can be converted to cubic centimeters .
The compression ratio arrived at with the formula will be the same regardless of whether cubic inches or cubic centimeters are used .
The only precaution is that all volumes used in the formula be quoted in the same terms .
The volume of the cylinder opening in the head gasket must be computed by multiplying its area in square inches by the gasket's thickness in thousandths of an inch .
Sometimes it is necessary to roughly calculate the square inch area of the opening but the calculation can usually be made with sufficient accuracy that it won't affect the final computation .
The volume of the opening is added to the combustion chamber volume .
Another thing that must be taken into consideration is the volume of the area between the top of the piston and the top of the cylinder block when the piston is in top dead center position .
Compute this volume by measuring the distance from the top of the block to the piston head as accurately as possible with a depth micrometer or some other precision measuring device and then multiply the area of the cylinder by the depth .
The formula for this step is : Af .
This volume is added to the total volume of the combustion chamber and head gasket opening .
The total of these three volumes is the `` final combustion chamber volume '' .
After the factors just described have been computed , they are applied to the following formula : Af
.
For an example let's dream up an engine that has a final combustion chamber volume of 5 cubic inches and a cylinder volume of 45 cubic inches .
Applying these figures to the formula we get the equation : Af .
The compression ratio is 10 to 1 .
This method of computing compression ratio cannot be used accurately for engines that have pistons with either domed or irregularly shaped heads .
Any irregularity on the piston heads will make it impossible , with normal means , to determine the final combustion chamber volume because the volume displaced by the piston heads cannot be readily computed .
The only way to determine the final combustion chamber volume when such pistons are used is by measuring it with liquid while the cylinder head is bolted to the cylinder block and the piston is in top dead center position .
Gear ratio -- speed relationships
There are four versions of the formula that involves the relationships of car speed , engine speed , rear axle gear ratio , and rear tire size .
By using the appropriate version any one of these factors can be determined for any combination of the other three .
To simplify the formulas a representative symbol is substituted for each of the factors .
These are
MPH for Car speed
, for Engine crankshaft speed
, for Rear axle gear ratio
, for Tire size
.
Tire size can be determined in several ways but the one that is the easiest and as accurate as any is by measuring the effective radius of a wheel and tire assembly .
This is done by measuring the distance from the surface on which the tire is resting to the center of the rear axle shaft .
A tire must be inflated to its normal hot operating pressure and the car must be loaded to its operating weight when this measurement is made .
The measurement must be in inches .
Any fraction of an inch involved in the measurement must be converted to a decimal equivalent to simplify the mathematics .
When tire size is measured in this manner a constant of 168 is used in the formula .
To determine car speed for a given combination of engine speed , gear ratio , and tire size , the formula is : Af .
For an engine speed of 5000 rpm , a gear ratio of 4.00 to 1 , and a tire radius of 13 inches , the equation would look like this : Af
.
To determine engine speed for a given combination of the other three factors the formula is : Af .
Using the same figures as for the previous example , the equation becomes : Af
.
To determine the rear axle gear ratio for a combination of the other three factors , the formula is : Af .
Using the figures from the previous examples , the equation becomes : Af .
Orlando , Fla. , Feb. 2
-- The best 2-year-old pacing mile up to date at Ben White Raceway has been that of Mary Liner ( Mainliner-Highland Ellen ) , a member of the Dick Williams stable , who was clocked 2:25 .
She is owned by Ralph H. Kroening , Milwaukee , Wis. , who , according to the railbirds , can feel justly proud of her .
Other good miles have been by Debonnie ( Dale Frost-Debby Hanover ) and Prompt Time ( Adios-On Time ) in 2:28-:36 ; ;
Kimberly Gal ( Galophone-Kimberly Hanover ) 2:26.2 ; ;
Laguerre Hanover ( Tar Heel-Lotus Hanover ) and Monel ( Tar Heel-Miracle Byrd ) in 2:34 .
Laguerre Hanover is outstanding in type and conformation -- good body , plenty of heart girth , stands straight on his legs on excellent feet -- and has the smoothest gait .
This colt is behind most of the other 2-year-olds in the Simpson stable but can show about as much pace as any of them .
Monel shows improvement with each work-out and looks the makings of a good brood mare after winning her share of races .
Stardel ( Star's Pride-Starlette Hanover ) , 2:34 , looks quite promising .
Fury Hanover ( Hoot Mon-Fay ) , Caper ( Hoot Mon-Columbia Hanover ) and Isaac ( Hoot Mon-Goddess Hanover ) has been working together but have not equalled their best work done some weeks ago .
Fury and Caper worked in 2:35 and did it with ease .
They are two good colts of different type .
Fury is upstanding and on the rangy side , and Caper is more the compact type .
I have never seen Caper off his feet -- he seems to know nothing but ' trot ' and keeps trying a little harder if asked to do so .
Fury has made a few mistakes but looks like a wonderful prospect , with his impressive gait and stride which certainly make him cover the ground .
Trackdown ( Torrid-Mighty Lady ) has worked a mile in 2:33.3 .
It took this colt several weeks to strike a pace .
Then , after emasculation , he was eased up for a couple of weeks .
He has thrived on all he has gone through and looks the makings of a good little race horse .
Thor Hanover ( Adios-Trustful Hanover ) is a wonderful looking prospect and another good individual , with solid , rugged conformation , good , flat bone and excellent feet .
This colt arrived at the Raceway early last November , and immediately was put into harness and line-driven for a few days , and then put to cart and broken in very nicely , knowing nothing but trot .
