I want to study your landlord's habits and movements first .
You see , I always make it look like an accident .
Maybe suicide , if it looks reasonable .
In that way there's no trouble for the customer '' .
Haney's eyebrows flew up .
`` Customer '' ? ?
Pete smiled modestly .
`` It's my line of work '' , he said
Five minutes later , before Haney could make his break , the stranger stood up and nodded farewell .
Haney watched the small but wiry man slip out the door quickly and silently , and felt relieved to see that nobody else seemed to notice his departure .
Phil decided to stay a little longer , and as time passed it seemed as if the strange little man had never been there , but for the other glass on the table .
Some time before midnight he returned to his apartment and hit the sack , putting the whole incident out of mind before he fell asleep .
The next day , Sunday , the hangover reminded Haney where he had been the night before .
The hangover in turn reminded him of his conversation with the weirdy , and he groaned .
He went for more aspirin later in the day , and passed the surly landlord on the way -- he was still alive and scowling as usual , as if tenants were a burden in his life .
Phil shrugged and ignored him .
He went back to work Monday .
By Wednesday the landlord was still alive .
Of course On Thursday , Haney mailed the monthly check for separate maintenance to his wife Lolly , and wished the stranger could do something about her
Coming home from work , he was startled to see a police car parked in front of the apartment building .
Inside the lobby , people were standing around , talking excitedly .
His spine crawled with a foreboding premonition as he asked one of his fellow tenants what had happened .
The landlord had died .
Late that afternoon , it seemed , he had fallen off the roof while on some obscure errand or inspection .
He had apparently been alone .
Nobody witnessed the fall -- just the sickening impact when his body smashed on the pavement just outside the basement delivery entrance .
Haney hoped that nobody noticed his sudden pallor , as he felt the blood drain from his cheeks .
He muttered something about how terrible it was , and walked with deliberate slowness to the elevator .
Once inside his apartment , he poured a drink with trembling hands and flopped limply in a chair .
After a while he began to feel better about it , especially when no one bothered to ask any questions .
But after all , why should they ? ?
Still later , he finally convinced himself that it was an accident -- just a coincidence .
The stranger really had nothing to do with it , of course
Haney went to bed , happy that at least he was rid of that lousy landlord .
After all , the man had no family , so no one suffered , and everybody was better off for it .
Really , he said to himself , nobody kills a man just as a favor ! !
So you thought I didn't mean what I said .
The stranger's eyes were large and sad , as if Phil Haney had hurt his feelings .
It was like a recurrent , annoying dream , but now the dream was beginning to take on overtones of a nightmare .
However , Haney knew it was not a dream .
He might be very tight , but he knew where he was .
It was the same bar , and it was two weeks later -- Saturday night , when he had an excuse to drink heavier than usual .
He had been sitting in the usual corner at the little table , as far as possible from any talkative , friendly lushes .
He was enjoying the weekly ritual of washing down his pet grievance with bourbon slightly moistened with water .
This favorite grievance was not the landlord .
He had already quite forgotten about him .
In fact , he had only mentioned him on the spur of the moment .
His real grievance was Lolly .
Toward the end of his fourth hairy highball , while he was moodily making wet rings on the table-top with the bottom of the glass , he became aware that he was not alone .
He looked up with bloodshot eyes and beheld the stranger sitting across the table , smiling a secret smile at him , as if they were fellow conspirators .
He hadn't even noticed -- what was his name ? ?
Pete ? ?
-- he hadn't seen him sit down .
The man was uncanny , like a shadow , and made as much noise as a shadow .
Haney felt like shrinking out of sight , but he was already trapped in the corner with the wiry , dark little man .
He began to wish that he hadn't shouted that other evening when the truck bore down through the crossing .
Was he going to be saddled from now on with a creep for a bar-buddy ? ?
He'd have to start going to some of the other places again .
In a low voice , almost whispering , the man had asked Phil if he was happy with the way the landlord had been taken off his back .
He made the mistake of answering in an offhand way , and instantly realized that his skepticism must have showed in his face or voice .
Pete frowned slightly , then became sad and moody .
Haney didn't want to encourage his company , but felt he ought to buy him a drink anyhow , to prevent possible trouble .
But there was no trouble .
The guy sulked over his drink , obviously upset by Haney's lack of appreciation .
To break the uncomfortable silence , Haney began to talk .
In time , and two drinks later , he was complaining bitterly about his wife , He was on the subject for ten minutes or so when he noticed the renewed interest in his listener -- it showed in the alert face and the suddenly bright eyes .
When he paused to moisten his throat , the stranger broke in .
`` But why pay her bills ? ?
If she runs around with other men , and if you hate her as you say , why not just divorce her '' ? ?
Haney scowled .
`` That bitch would love a divorce '' , he growled .
`` Then she'd get half of everything I have .
Community property deal -- you know .
I'd have to sell out my business to pay her off with her share .
She can drop dead '' ! !
Pete nodded understandingly .
`` Oh yes .
Now I see .
You must understand , I haven't been in this state too long .
I came out here to retire .
That's why I -- why I do a free job now and then .
You should have told me about her before '' .
Haney felt a twinge of annoyance when he heard the now familiar line again .
Then a wild thought ran circles through his clouded brain .
Suppose -- just suppose this guy was really what he said he was ! !
A retired professional killer If he was just a nut , no harm was done .
But if he was the real thing , he could do something about Lolly .
He felt very cunning , very proud of himself as he played on the other man's soft spot .
`` No offense intended '' , he said gently .
`` But it's just that -- well , you know .
The cops didn't suspect a thing , and I thought it was a coincidence .
After all , I didn't know you , Pete .
It could have been an accident '' .
He shrugged casually .
`` But if you say you managed it '' The stranger was hooked .
His eyes burned feverishly .
`` Yes , yes '' , he muttered impatiently .
`` Of course it looked like an accident .
I always work it that way -- and always at a time when the customer has an alibi .
Let me prove it , Phil .
I think I can manage one more favor for you '' .
He waited eagerly .
Haney swished the liquor in the bottom of his glass .
About halfway back Pops groped against a wall and stopped , pulled away two loosely nailed wide boards at one end , and went through .
`` C'mon '' , he whispered ; ;
`` floor level's about three feet down , so don't fall '' .
I went through and down , into pitch darkness .
He said , `` Jist stay still .
I'll pull the boards back and then get us a light .
Jist stay where you are '' .
I jist stayed where I was while he fumbled around and then walked away .
A moment later he struck a match and lighted a candle , and I could see .
It was a big room , empty except for a few things of Pops's at the far end -- a wooden crate on which stood the candle , a spread out blanket , and an unrolled bindle .
I looked back over my shoulder while I went to join him ; ;
he'd hung another half of a blanket over the boarded window so no light would show through .
I took the pint bottle from my pocket and handed it over as I sat down beside him on the spread blanket .
`` You first '' , I said .
He drank and handed it back .
`` Nice place '' , I told him .
`` Listen , I got a buddy I travel with , real nice guy named Larry .
I know where he is , right near here .
Could he join the party and sleep here tonight too ? ?
We'll both be blowing town tomorrow so we won't be moving in on you '' .
He hesitated a second , looking at the bottle , before he said `` Sure-sure '' , and I reassured him .
`` He'll bring a bottle too , and I'll get another one or maybe two while I'm out .
You can work on this one while I'm gone , kill it if you want '' .
I took a short swallow from it myself and handed it to him .
His `` sure-sure '' was enthusiastic this time .
He put the bottle down .
`` Git over by the window while there's light , an' I'll put th' candle out .
When yuh come back I'll put it out agin till you're both inside '' .
Charlie was waiting , leaning against a building front .
`` Perfect set-up '' , I told him .
`` But we got to go back to Fifth and get another bottle or two .
On the way I'll give you the scoop '' .
On the way I gave him the scoop .
I bought another pint of sherry and when we got back Pops let us in in the dark , put back the blanket and then lighted the candle again .
I introduced my friend Larry to Pops and we made ourselves comfortable .
There was still a little , not much , left in the first bottle and we passed it around once and killed it , and Charlie opened his .
I was reminded , amusedly , by a poem of Kenneth Patchen's called The Murder of Two Men by a Young Kid Wearing Lemon Colored Gloves , which Patchen himself read on a record against jazz background .
The poem consisted of only two words , the word `` Wait '' , repeated over and over at irregular intervals and with different inflections , and then the word `` Now '' ! !
And a blaring final chord from the jazz group .
This was the same , except that it was the murder of one man by two men and neither of us was wearing gloves .
But we could wait all right ; ;
there was no hurry .
I said , `` Wait wait '' to Charlie and he grinned , digging the reference .
We'd heard the record together once .
The second bottle passed a few times .
Pops was taking long ones , but not showing the effect yet .
He seemed as drunk as when I'd first talked to him , but no drunker .
He had a capacity ; ;
if we'd really been trying to get him dead drunk we'd have had to go out for more wine .
About halfway through the second bottle , Charlie looked at me across Pops , who was sitting between us and asked `` Now '' ? ?
I said , `` Wait '' , and handed the bottle to Pops for his final drink .
When he handed it back and I had hold of it safely , Pops was looking toward me and I said `` Now '' , to Charlie and he swung the short length of lead pipe he'd meanwhile taken from his pocket , once .
It was a lead pipe cinch .
There was a sound like the one you produce by flicking a watermelon with your finger , only louder , and Pops fell forward from the waist and then over sidewise .
Out cold , if not dead ; ;
and he'd never known what hit him -- he'd never known that anything had hit him .
I reached my hand toward him to put it inside his shirt to feel for a heartbeat , but Charlie said `` Wait '' ! !
-- and said it sharply , not as in the Patchen bit , but as an order -- so I stopped my hand and looked at him .
He was holding the piece of lead pipe out to me .
`` We don't want to know whether he's dead , yet .
I gauged that blow to be borderline .
To kayo him and maybe or maybe not kill .
You hit again about twice that hard before we know whether he's dead or not .
That way we'll never know which of us really killed him and which was just the accomplice .
Dig '' ? ?
I dug him , I saw his point ; ;
it made sense .
I took the piece of pipe from Charlie's hand and used it , harder than he had .
The thunk was louder , anyway , and I thought I heard bone crack .
Charlie said , `` Good boy .
That did it , if mine didn't .
And we'll never know which .
All right , now I'll give you a hand '' .
We straightened Pops up and I made sure there was no trace of a heartbeat .
I nodded to Charlie .
`` Let's put him down again the way he was .
It's a more natural position '' .
We did that .
`` How do you feel '' ? ?
Charlie asked me .
`` Cool '' , I told him .
`` What do you feel '' ? ?
`` Nothing .
Well maybe I'm exaggerating .
It was a kick , but not a big enough one for me to want to take the chance again , except for stakes .
But let's not talk about it abstractly until we're out of here .
Now , first question : the bottles .
Shall we take them all with us , or leave one '' ? ?
`` Take them '' , I said .
`` If we left one we'd have to wipe it for fingerprints .
Here's the picture we want to leave for the fuzz -- whenever the body gets found .
This happened in the middle of a drinking bout with another bum .
If they'd been working on a bottle or a jug he'd have taken it with him '' .
`` Right .
And he'd have taken the weapon with him too , so we take that .
Now '' -- He looked around .
`` I've been careful about fingerprints .
How about you '' ? ?
`` Same .
There are the boards over the window , of course , but they're not painted and too rough to take prints .
Same goes for the rough cement of the ledge .
Besides , I doubt if the cops will even try dusting .
They find dead winos every day , maybe they won't even autopsy him for the cause of death '' .
`` We can't take a chance on that .
We've got to assume they'll decide he was murdered and we've got to keep the picture consistent .
Our hypothetical other bum who killed him would have turned out his pockets .
Let's do that '' .
We did that and found a dirty handkerchief , some matches and fourteen cents in change .
We took the matches -- they were book matches and once they'd been touched might retain fingerprints -- and the change .
We discussed the candle and decided the hypothetical other bum would have left it burning to light his way to the window and because he'd have no reason to blow it out .
The candle had been stuck on a tin lid so it wouldn't set fire to the crate when it guttered out .
A fire wouldn't have mattered except that it would cause Pops to be found sooner .
He might not be found for days , even weeks , otherwise .
We went once more over every point , then triple-checked .
Being picked up for questioning by a cop on the way out seemed to be the only possible remaining danger , and we weren't picked up by a cop .
In fact , nobody saw us , cop or citizen .
Winsett is a quiet street with no taverns and was completely deserted at that hour .
Which , if it matters , was one A.M. .
Less than three hours ago we'd decided , in Maxine Wells's pad on Cosmo , to commit a trial murder .
It had gone like clockwork .
Almost too smoothly , I found myself thinking , and then told myself that was ridiculous .
How safe is too safe ? ?
Thinking like that can get you into a padded pad .
An hour later we were back in my unpadded pad , killing what had been left of the second pint .
We decided to leave the third one intact for tomorrow .
Also our plans for me to commit Charlie's murder and for him to commit mine .
But we were really going to do it .
We shook hands on it .
We planned ahead only one step , a rendezvous for tomorrow when we could swap notes .
I'd tell him everything I'd learned about Seaton's habits and habitat , and he'd tell me the score on Radic .
We made the date for two o'clock in the afternoon at Maxine Wells's pad .
Charlie would get there early because he had the key .
From here on in , the less Charlie and I were seen together in public , or visited one another's rooms , the better .
I was dead tired and slept soundly , as far as I know dreamlessly .
We met at Maxine's and decided we were set to stay as long as it took , into or even through the evening , to talk things out .
Charlie had brought food and we'd decided on no drinks .
I'd brought along the virgin pint from last night , but we were going to kill that only when we were through talking .
I talked first , telling him everything I knew about Seaton and his house and domestic arrangements .
I drew diagrams and floor plans ; ;
he memorized them thoroughly and then we tore them into tiny pieces and flushed them down .
He gave me equivalent and even more detailed dope on Radic , including diagrams -- one of the apartment building Radic lived in and one of the apartment itself .
He'd been there several times , back when , while he and Radic had been friends , or at least not enemies .
It didn't take us as long as we'd thought it might ; ;
it was not quite six o'clock when we finished and Charlie said , `` Well , I guess that's it .
Shall we flip a coin to see which of us goes first ? ?
Or would you rather deal a hand of show-down poker or play a game of gin rummy , or what '' ? ?
`` Wait a minute , Charlie '' , I said .
`` One thing we haven't discussed , expense money .
We'll need some at least , if only bus fare to the scene of the crime .
And if you're as flat broke as I am , I think we'll have to take the added risk of knocking over a filling station or something before we split for one of us to set up an alibi while the other does his dirty work '' .
He sighed .
`` All right , I'll come clean .
I've got a little stashed for a rainy day , and I guess this is rainy enough .
A couple of hundred .
If you draw the short straw I'll lend you some bread , like fifty bucks , before I take off to visit my sister in Frisco .
Then , after I'm back , another fifty so you can put some mileage on yourself and have a solid alibi somewhere while I take care of your seat cover boy '' .
`` Solid '' , I said .
I took a deep breath , and the plunge .
`` In that case , let's not draw .
I'll go to bat first .
You'd have to wait till Seaton's back from Mexico City and also while I set it up with Doris to have her have an alibi for D-night .
So it wouldn't be for days or even a week before you could do anything .
But your friend Manny can go any time '' .
He grinned and clapped me on the shoulder .
`` I was hoping you'd say that , Willy .
But I wouldn't have suggested it .
Well -- in that case , I take off tomorrow morning for Frisco .
And , in case , I brought the money with me '' .
Now that he knew himself to be self he was free to grok ever closer to his brothers , merge without let .
Self's integrity was and is and ever had been .
Mike stopped to cherish all his brother selves , the many threes-fulfilled on Mars , corporate and discorporate , the precious few on Earth -- the unknown powers of three on Earth that would be his to merge with and cherish now that at last long waiting he grokked and cherished himself .
Mike remained in trance ; ;
there was much to grok , loose ends to puzzle over and fit into his growing -- all that he had seen and heard and been at the Archangel Foster Tabernacle ( not just cusp when he and Digby had come face to face alone ) why Bishop Senator Boone made him warily uneasy , how Miss Dawn Ardent tasted like a water brother when she was not , the smell of goodness he had incompletely grokked in the jumping up and down and wailing --
Jubal's conversations coming and going -- Jubal's words troubled him most ; ;
he studied them , compared them with what he had been taught as a nestling , struggling to bridge between languages , the one he thought with and the one he was learning to think in .
The word `` church '' which turned up over and over again among Jubal's words gave him knotty difficulty ; ;
there was no Martian concept to match it -- unless one took `` church '' and `` worship '' and `` God '' and `` congregation '' and many other words and equated them to the totality of the only world he had known during growing-waiting then forced the concept back into English in that phrase which had been rejected ( by each differently ) by Jubal , by Mahmoud , by Digby .
`` Thou art God '' .
He was closer to understanding it in English now , although it could never have the inevitability of the Martian concept it stood for .
In his mind he spoke simultaneously the English sentence and the Martian word and felt closer grokking .
Repeating it like a student telling himself that the jewel is in the lotus he sank into nirvana .
Before midnight he speeded his heart , resumed normal breathing , ran down his check list , uncurled and sat up .
He had been weary ; ;
now he felt light and gay and clear-headed , ready for the many actions he saw spreading out before him .
He felt a puppyish need for company as strong as his earlier necessity for quiet .
He stepped out into the hall , was delighted to encounter a water brother .
`` Hi '' ! !
`` Oh .
Hello , Mike .
My , you look chipper '' .
`` I feel fine ! !
Where is everybody '' ? ?
`` Asleep .
Ben and Stinky went home an hour ago and people started going to bed '' .
`` Oh '' .
Mike felt disappointed that Mahmoud had left ; ;
he wanted to explain his new grokking .
`` I ought to be asleep , too , but I felt like a snack .
Are you hungry '' ? ?
`` Sure , I'm hungry '' ! !
`` Come on , there's some cold chicken and we'll see what else '' .
They went downstairs , loaded a tray lavishly .
`` Let's take it outside .
It's plenty warm '' .
`` A fine idea '' , Mike agreed .
`` Warm enough to swim -- real Indian summer .
I'll switch on the floods '' .
`` Don't bother '' , Mike answered .
`` I'll carry the tray '' .
He could see in almost total darkness .
Jubal said that his night-sight probably came from the conditions in which he had grown up , and Mike grokked this was true but grokked that there was more to it ; ;
his foster parents had taught him to see .
As for the night being warm , he would have been comfortable naked on Mount Everest but his water brothers had little tolerance for changes in temperature and pressure ; ;
he was considerate of their weakness , once he learned of it .
But he was looking forward to snow -- seeing for himself that each tiny crystal of the water of life was a unique individual , as he had read -- walking barefoot , rolling in it .
In the meantime he was pleased with the warm night and the still more pleasing company of his water brother .
`` Okay , take the tray .
I'll switch on the underwater lights .
That'll be plenty to eat by '' .
`` Fine '' .
Mike liked having light up through the ripples ; ;
it was a goodness , beauty .
They picnicked by the pool , then lay back on the grass and looked at stars .
`` Mike , there's Mars .
It is Mars , isn't it ? ?
Or Antares '' ? ?
`` It is Mars '' .
`` Mike ? ?
What are they doing on Mars '' ? ?
He hesitated ; ;
the question was too wide for the sparse English language .
`` On the side toward the horizon -- the southern hemisphere -- it is spring ; ;
plants are being taught to grow '' .
`` ' Taught to grow ' '' ? ?
He hesitated .
`` Larry teaches plants to grow .
I have helped him .
But my people -- Martians , I mean ; ;
I now grok you are my people -- teach plants another way .
In the other hemisphere it is growing colder and nymphs , those who stayed alive through the summer , are being brought into nests for quickening and more growing '' .
He thought .
`` Of the humans we left at the equator , one has discorporated and the others are sad '' .
Yes , I heard it in the news '' .
Mike had not heard it ; ;
he had not known it until asked .
`` They should not be sad .
Mr. Booker T. W. Jones Food Technician First Class is not sad ; ;
the Old Ones have cherished him '' .
`` You knew him '' ? ?
`` Yes .
He had his own face , dark and beautiful .
But he was homesick '' .
`` Oh , dear ! !
Mike do you ever get homesick ? ?
For Mars '' ? ?
`` At first I was homesick '' , he answered .
`` I was lonely always '' .
He rolled toward her and took her in his arms .
`` But now I am not lonely .
I grok I shall never be lonely again '' .
`` Mike darling '' -- They kissed , and went on kissing .
Presently his water brother said breathlessly .
`` Oh , my ! !
That was almost worse than the first time '' .
`` You are all right , my brother '' ? ?
`` Yes .
Yes indeed .
Kiss me again '' .
A long time later , by cosmic clock , she said , `` Mike ? ?
Is that -- I mean , ' Do you know ' '' --
`` I know .
It is for growing closer .
Now we grow closer '' .
`` Well I've been ready a long time -- goodness , we all have , but never mind , dear ; ;
turn just a little .
I'll help '' .
As they merged , grokking together , Mike said softly and triumphantly : `` Thou art God '' .
Her answer was not in words .
Then , as their grokking made them ever closer and Mike felt himself almost ready to discorporate her voice called him back : `` Oh ! !
Oh ! !
Thou art God '' ! !
`` We grok God '' .
25 .
On Mars humans were building pressure domes for the male and female party that would arrive by next ship .
This went faster than scheduled as the Martians were helpful .
Part of the time saved was spent on a preliminary estimate for a long-distance plan to free bound oxygen in the sands of Mars to make the planet more friendly to future human generations .
The Old Ones neither helped nor hindered this plan ; ;
time was not yet .
Their meditations were approaching a violent cusp that would shape Martian art for many millennia .
On Earth elections continued and a very advanced poet published a limited edition of verse consisting entirely of punctuation marks and spaces ; ;
Time magazine reviewed it and suggested that the Federation Assembly Daily Record should be translated into the medium .
A colossal campaign opened to sell more sexual organs of plants and Mrs. Joseph ( `` Shadow of Greatness '' ) Douglas was quoted as saying : `` I would no more sit down without flowers on my table than without serviettes '' .
A Tibetan swami from Palermo , Sicily , announced in Beverly Hills a newly discovered , ancient yoga discipline for ripple breathing which increased both pranha and cosmic attraction between sexes .
His chelas were required to assume the matsyendra posture dressed in hand-woven diapers while he read aloud from Rig-Veda and an assistant guru examined their purses in another room -- nothing was stolen ; ;
the purpose was less immediate .
The President of the United States proclaimed the first Sunday in November as `` National Grandmothers' Day '' and urged America to say it with flowers .
A funeral parlor chain was indicted for price-cutting .
Fosterite bishops , after secret conclave , announced the Church's second Major Miracle : Supreme Bishop Digby had been translated bodily to Heaven and spot-promoted to Archangel , ranking with-but-after Archangel Foster .
The glorious news had been held up pending Heavenly confirmation of the elevation of a new Supreme Bishop , Huey Short -- a candidate accepted by the Boone faction after lots had been cast repeatedly .
L'Unita and Hoy published identical denunciations of Short's elevation , l'Osservatore Romano and the Christian Science Monitor ignored it , Times of India snickered at it , and the Manchester Guardian simply reported it -- the Fosterites in England were few but extremely militant .
Digby was not pleased with his promotion .
The Man from Mars had interrupted him with his work half finished -- and that stupid jackass Short was certain to louse it up .
Foster listened with angelic patience until Digby ran down , then said , `` Listen , junior , you're an angel now -- so forget it .
Eternity is no time for recriminations .
You too were a stupid jackass until you poisoned me .
Afterwards you did well enough .
Now that Short is Supreme Bishop he'll do all right , he can't help it .
Same as with the Popes .
Some of them were warts until they got promoted .
Check with one of them , go ahead -- there's no professional jealousy here '' .
Digby calmed down , but made one request .
Foster shook his halo .
`` You can't touch him .
You shouldn't have tried to .
Oh , you can submit a requisition for a miracle if you want to make a fool of yourself .
But , I'm telling you , it'll be turned down -- you don't understand the System yet .
The Martians have their own setup , different from ours , and as long as they need him , we can't touch him .
They run their show their way -- the Universe has variety , something for everybody -- a fact you field workers often miss '' .
`` You mean this punk can brush me aside and I've got to hold still for it '' ? ?
`` I held still for the same thing , didn't I ? ?
I'm helping you now , am I not ? ?
Now look , there's work to be done and lots of it .
The Boss wants performance , not gripes .
If you need a Day off to calm down , duck over to the Muslim Paradise and take it .
Otherwise , straighten your halo , square your wings , and dig in .
The sooner you act like an angel the quicker you'll feel angelic .
Get Happy , junior '' ! !
Digby heaved a deep ethereal sigh .
`` Okay , I'm Happy .
Where do I start '' ? ?
Jubal did not hear of Digby's disappearance when it was announced , and , when he did , while he had a fleeting suspicion , he dismissed it ; ;
if Mike had had a finger in it , he had gotten away with it -- and what happened to supreme bishops worried Jubal not at all as long as he wasn't bothered .
His household had gone through an upset .
Jubal deduced what had happened but did not know with whom -- and didn't want to inquire .
Mike was of legal age and presumed able to defend himself in the clinches .
Anyhow , it was high time the boy was salted .
Jubal couldn't reconstruct the crime from the way the girls behaved because patterns kept shifting -- ABC vs D , then BCD vs A or AB vs CD , or AD vs CB , through all ways that four women can gang up on each other .
This continued most of the week following that ill-starred trip to church , during which period Mike stayed in his room and usually in a trance so deep that Jubal would have pronounced him dead had he not seen it before .
Jubal would not have minded it if service had not gone to pieces .
The girls seemed to spend half their time tiptoeing in `` to see if Mike was all right '' and they were too preoccupied to cook , much less be secretaries .
Even rock-steady Anne -- Hell , Anne was the worst ! !
Absent-minded , subject to unexplained tears Jubal would have bet his life that if Anne were to witness the Second Coming , she would memorize date , time , personae , events , and barometric pressure without batting her calm blue eyes .
The expense and time involved are astronomical .
However , we sent a third vessel out , a much smaller and faster one than the first two .
We have learned much about interstellar drives since a hundred years ago ; ;
that is all I can tell you about them .
`` But the third ship came back several years ago and reported ''
`` That it had found a planet on which human beings could live and which was already inhabited by sentient beings '' ! !
Said Hal , forgetting in his enthusiasm that he had not been asked to speak .
Macneff stopped pacing to stare at Hal with his pale blue eyes .
`` How did you know '' ? ?
He said sharply .
`` Forgive me , Sandalphon '' , said Hal .
`` But it was inevitable ! !
Did not the Forerunner predict in his Time and the World Line that such a planet would be found ? ?
I believe it was on page 573 '' ! !
Macneff smiled and said , `` I am glad that your scriptural lessons have left such an impression '' .
How could they not ? ?
Thought Hal .
Besides , they were not the only impressions .
I still bear scars on my back where Pornsen , my gapt , whipped me because I had not learned my lessons well enough .
He was a good impresser , that Pornsen .
Was ? ?
Is ! !
As I grew older and was promoted , so was he , always where I was .
He was my gapt in the creche .
He was the dormitory gapt when I went to college and thought I was getting away from him .
He is now my block gapt .
He is the one responsible for my getting such low M. R.'s .
Swiftly , came the revulsion , the protest .
No , not he , for I , and I alone , am responsible for whatever happens to me .
If I get a low M. R. , I do so because I want it that way or my dark self does .
If I die , I die because I willed it so .
So , forgive me , Sigmen , for the contrary-to-reality thoughts ! !
`` Please pardon me again , Sandalphon '' , said Hal .
`` But did the expedition find any records of the Forerunner having been on this planet ? ?
Perhaps , even , though this is too much to wish , find the Forerunner himself '' ? ?
`` No '' , said Macneff .
`` Though that does not mean that there may not be such records there .
The expedition was under orders to make a swift survey of conditions and then to return to Earth .
I can't tell you now the distance in lightyears or what star this was , though you can see it with the naked eye at night in this hemisphere .
If you volunteer , you will be told where you're going after the ship leaves .
And it leaves very soon '' .
`` You need a linguist '' ? ?
Said Hal .
`` The ship is huge '' , said Macneff , `` but the number of military men and specialists we are taking limits the linguists to one .
We have considered several of your professionals because they were lamechians and above suspicion .
Unfortunately ''
Hal waited : Macneff paced some more , frowning .
Then , he said , `` Unfortunately , only one lamechian linguist exists , and he is too old for this expedition .
Therefore ''
`` A thousand pardons '' , said Hal .
`` But I have just thought of one thing .
I am married '' .
`` No problem at all '' , said Macneff .
`` There will be no women aboard the Gabriel .
And , if a man is married , he will automatically be given a divorce '' .
Hal gasped , and he said , `` A divorce '' ? ?
Macneff raised his hands apologetically and said , `` You are horrified , of course .
But , from our reading of the Western Talmud , we Urielites believe that the Forerunner , knowing this situation would arise , made reference to and provision for divorce .
It's inevitable in this case , for the couple will be separated for , at the least , forty years .
Naturally , he couched the provision in obscure language .
In his great and glorious wisdom , he knew that our enemies the Israelites must not be able to read therein what we planned '' .
`` I volunteer '' , said Hal .
`` Tell me more , Sandalphon '' .
Six months later , Hal Yarrow stood in the observation dome of the Gabriel and watched the ball of Earth dwindle above him .
It was night on this hemisphere , but the light blazed from the megalopolises of Australia , Japan , China , Southeast Asia , India , Siberia .
Hal , the linguist , saw the glittering discs and necklaces in terms of the languages spoken therein .
Australia , the Philippine Islands , Japan , and northern China were inhabited by those members of the Haijac Union that spoke American .
Southern China , all of southeast Asia , southern India and Ceylon , these states of the Malay Federation spoke Bazaar .
Siberia spoke Icelandic .
His mind turned the globe swiftly for him , and he visualized Africa , which used Swahili south of the Sahara Sea .
All around the Mediterranean Sea , Asia Minor , northern India , and Tibet , Hebrew was the native tongue .
In southern Europe , between the Israeli Republics and the Icelandic-speaking peoples of northern Europe , was a thin but long stretch of territory called March .
This was no man's land , disputed by the Haijac Union and the Israeli Republic , a potential source of war for the last two hundred years .
Neither nation would give up their claim on it , yet neither wished to make any move that might lead to a second Apocalyptic War .
So , for all practical purposes , it was an independent nation and by now had its own organized government ( unrecognized outside its own borders ) .
Its citizens spoke all of the world's surviving tongues , plus a new one called Lingo , a pidgin whose vocabulary was derived from the other six and whose syntax was so simple it could be contained on half a sheet of paper .
Hal saw in his mind the rest of Earth : Iceland , Greenland , the Caribbean Islands , and the eastern half of South America .
Here the peoples spoke the tongue of Iceland because that island had gotten the jump on the Hawaiian-Americans who were busy resettling North America and the western half of South America after the Apocalyptic War .
Then there was North America , where American was the native speech of all except the twenty descendants of French-Canadians living on the Hudson Bay Preserve .
Hal knew that when that side of Earth rotated into the night zone , Sigmen City would blaze out into space .
And , somewhere in that enormous light , was his apartment .
But Mary would soon no longer be living there , for she would be notified in a few days that her husband had died in an accident while on a flight to Tahiti .
She would weep in private , he was sure , for she loved him in her frigid way , though in public she would be dry-eyed .
Her friends and professional associates would sympathize with her , not because she had lost a beloved husband , but because she had been married to a man who thought unrealistically .
If Hal Yarrow had been killed in a crash , he must have wanted it that way .
There was no such thing as an `` accident '' .
Somehow , all the other passengers ( also supposed to have died in this web of elaborate frauds to cover up the disappearance of the personnel of the Gabriel ) had simultaneously `` agreed '' to die .
And , therefore , being in disgrace , they would not be cremated and their ashes flung to the winds in public ceremony .
No , the fish could eat their bodies for all the Sturch cared .
Hal felt sorry for Mary ; ;
he had a time keeping the tears from welling to his own eyes as he stood in the crowd in the observation dome .
Yet , he told himself , this was the best way .
He and Mary would no longer have to tear and rend at each other ; ;
their mutual torture would be over .
Mary was free to marry again , not knowing that the Sturch had secretly given her a divorce , thinking that death had dissolved her marriage .
She would have a year in which to make up her mind , to choose a mate from a list selected by her gapt .
Perhaps , the psychological barriers that had prevented her from conceiving Hal's child would no longer be present .
Perhaps .
Hal doubted if this happy event would occur .
Mary was as frozen below the navel as he .
No matter who the candidate for marriage selected by the gapt
The gapt .
Pornsen .
He would no longer have to see that fat face , hear that whining voice
`` Hal Yarrow '' ! !
Said the whining voice .
And , slowly , feeling himself icy yet burning , Hal turned .
There was the squat loose-jowled man , smiling lopsidedly up at him .
`` My beloved ward , my perennial gadfly '' , said the whining voice .
`` I had no idea that you , too , would be on this glorious voyage .
But I might have known ! !
We seem to be bound by love ; ;
Sigmen himself must have foreseen it .
Love to you , my ward '' .
`` Sigmen love you , too , my guardian '' , said Hal , choking .
`` How wonderful to see your cherished self .
I had thought we would never again speak to each other '' .

the Gabriel pointed towards her destination and , under one-gee acceleration , began to build up towards her ultimate velocity , 99.1 percent of the speed of light .
Meanwhile , all the personnel except those few needed to carry out the performance of the ship , went into the suspensor .
Here they would lie in suspended animation for many years .
Some time later , after a check had been made of all automatic equipment , the crew would join the others .
They would sleep while the Gabriel's drive would increase the acceleration to a point which the unfrozen bodies of the personnel could not have endured .
Upon reaching the desired speed , the automatic equipment would cut off the drive , and the silent but not empty vessel would hurl towards the star which was its journey's end .
Many years later , the photon-counting apparatus in the nose of the ship would determine that the star was close enough to actuate deceleration .
Again , a force too strong for unfrozen bodies to endure would be applied .
Then , after slowing the vessel considerably , the drive would adjust to a one-gee deceleration .
And the crew would be automatically brought out of their suspended animation .
These members would then unthaw the rest of the personnel .
And , in the half-year left before reaching their destination , the men would carry out whatever preparations were needed .
Hal Yarrow was among the last to go into the suspensor and among the first to come out .
He had to study the recordings of the language of the chief nation of Ozagen , Siddo .
And , from the first , he faced a difficult task .
The expedition that had discovered Ozagen had succeeded in correlating two thousand Siddo words with an equal number of American words .
The description of the Siddo syntax was very restricted .
And , as Hal found out , obviously mistaken in many cases .
This discovery caused Hal anxiety .
His duty was to write a school text and to teach the entire personnel of the Gabriel how to speak Ozagen .
Yet , if he used all of the little means at his disposal , he would be instructing his students wrongly .
Moreover , even getting this across would be difficult .
For one thing , the organs of speech of the Ozagen natives differed somewhat from Earthmen's ; ;
the sounds made by these organs were , therefore , dissimilar .
It was true that they could be approximated , but would the Ozagenians understand these approximations ? ?
Another obstacle was the grammatical construction of Siddo .
Consider the tense system .
Instead of inflecting a verb or using an unattached particle to indicate the past or future , Siddo used an entirely different word .
Thus , the masculine animate infinitive dabhumaksanigalu'ahai , meaning to live , was , in the perfect tense , ksu'u'peli'afo , and , in the future , mai'teipa .
The same use of an entirely different word applied for all the other tenses .
Plus the fact that Siddo not only had the normal ( to Earthmen ) three genders of masculine , feminine , and neuter , but the two extra of inanimate and spiritual .
Fortunately , gender was inflected , though the expression of it would be difficult for anybody not born in Siddo .
The system of indicating gender varied according to tense .
All the other parts of speech : nouns , pronouns , adjectives , adverbs , and conjunctions operated under the same system as the verbs .
This was not , for the Angel , just a matter of running through a logical or deductive chain , or deciding on some action from some already established premise .
No doubt the Angels could do that kind of thing as fast as any computer .
What Gabriel was being asked to do now , however , was to re-examine all his basic assumptions , make value-judgments on them , and give them new and different powers in his mind to govern his motives .
This is not wholly a reasoning process -- a computer cannot do it all -- and even in an Angel it takes time .
( Or , perhaps , especially in an Angel , whose assumptions had mostly been fixed millions of years ago .
)
Being reasonably sure of the reason for the long pause , however , did not make it seem any less long to Jack .
He had already become used to Hesperus' snapping back answers to questions almost before Jack could get them asked .
There was nothing he could do but wait .
The dice were cast .
At last Gabriel spoke .
`` We misjudged you '' , he said slowly .
`` We had concluded that no race as ephemeral as yours could have had time to develop a sense of justice .
Of course we have before us the example of the great races at the galactic center ; ;
individually they are nearly as mortal as you -- the difference does not seem very marked to us , where it exists .
But they have survived for long periods as races , whereas you are young .
We shall recommend to them that they shorten your trial period by half .
`` For now , it is clear that we were in the wrong .
You may reclaim your property , and the penalty on Hesperus is lifted .
Hesperus , you may speak '' .
`` I did not perceive this essential distinction either , First-Born '' , Hesperus said at once , `` I was only practicing a concept that Jack taught me , called a deal '' .
`` Nevertheless , you were its agent .
Jack , what is the nature of this concept '' ? ?
`` It's a kind of agreement in which each party gives something to the other '' , Jack said .
`` We regard it as fair only when each party feels that what he has received is as valuable , or more valuable , than what he has given '' .
His heart , he discovered , was pounding .
`` For instance , Hesperus agreed to help me find my property , and I agreed to take him to Earth .
Between individuals , this process is called bargaining .
When it is done between races or nations , it is called making a treaty .
And the major part of my mission to your nest is to make a treaty between your race and mine .
Recovering the property was much less important '' .
`` Strange '' , Gabriel said .
`` And apparently impossible .
Though it might be that we would have much to give you , you have nothing to give us '' .
`` Hesperus and Lucifer '' , Jack said , `` show that we do '' .
Another pause ; ;
but this one was not nearly as long .
`` Then it is a matter of pleasure ; ;
of curiosity ; ;
of a more alive time .
Yes , those could be commodities under this concept .
But you should understand , Jack , that Hesperus and Lucifer are not long out of the nursery .
Visiting the Earth would not be an offering of worth to those of us who are older '' .
This explained a great deal .
`` All the more reason , then '' , Jack said , `` why we must have a treaty .
We will gladly entertain your young and give them proper living quarters , in return for their help in running our fusion reactors .
But we must know if this is in accordance with your customs , and must have your agreement they will not misuse the power we put in their hands , to our hurt '' .
`` But this simply requires that they behave in accordance with the dictates of their own natures , and respect yours in turn .
To this we of course agree '' .
Jack felt a wave of complete elation , but in a second it had vanished without a trace .
What Gabriel was asking was that mankind forego all its parochial moral judgments , and contract to let the Angels serve on Earth as it is in Heaven regardless of the applicable Earth laws .
The Angels in turn would exercise similar restraints in respect for the natural preferences and natures of the Earthmen -- but they had no faintest notion of man's perverse habit of passing and enforcing laws which were contrary to his own preferences and violations of his nature .
The simple treaty principle that Gabriel was asking him to ratify , in short , was nothing less than total trust .
Nothing less would serve .
And it might be , considering the uncomfortable custom the Angels had of thinking of everything in terms of absolutes , that the proposal of anything less might well amount instead to something like a declaration of war .
Furthermore , even the highly trained law clerk who was a part of Jack's total make-up could not understand how the principle could ever be codified .
Almost the whole experience of mankind pointed toward suspicion , not trust , as the safest and sanest attitude toward all outsiders .
Yet there was some precedent for it .
The history of disarmament agreements , for instance , had been unreassuringly dismal ; ;
but the United States and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics nevertheless did eventually agree on an atomic bomb test ban , and a sort of provisional acceptance of each other's good intentions on this limited question .
Out of that agreement , though not by any easy road , eventually emerged the present world hegemony of the United Nations ; ;
suspicion between member states still existed , but it was of about the same low order of virulence as the twentieth-century rivalry between Arizona and California over water supplies .
Besides , agreements `` in principle '' , with the petty details to be thrashed out later , were commonplace in diplomatic history .
The trouble with them was that they almost never worked , and in fact an agreement `` in principle '' historically turned out to be a sure sign that neither party really wanted the quarrel settled .
Suppose that this one were to work ? ?
There was no question in Jack's mind of the good faith on one side , at least .
If mankind could be convinced of that
It was worth trying .
In fact , it had to be tried .
It would be at once the most tentative and most final treaty that Earth had ever signed .
Secretary Hart had taught Jack , at least partially , to be content with small beginnings in all diplomatic matters ; ;
but there was no small way to handle this one .
He turned back to the screens , the crucial , conclusive phrase on his lips .
But he was too late .
He had lost his audience .
For a moment he could make no sense at all of what he saw .
It seemed to be only a riot of color , light and meaningless activity .
Gradually , he realized that the pentagon of Angel elders had vanished , and that the ritual learning dance of the nursery had been broken up .
The Angels in the nursery were zigzagging wildly in all directions , seemingly at random .
`` Hesperus ! !
What's going on here ? ?
What's happened '' ? ?
`` Your brothers have been found .
They are on their way here '' .
`` Where ? ?
I don't see them .
The instruments don't show them '' .
`` You can't see them yet , Jack .
They'll be in range in a short while '' .
Jack scanned the skies , the boards , and the skies again .
Nothing .
No -- there was a tiny pip on the radar ; ;
and it was getting bigger rapidly .
If that was the skiff , it was making unprecedented speed .
Then the skiff hove into sight , just a dot of light at first against the roiling blackness and crimson streaks of the Coal Sack .
Through the telescope , Jack could see that both spacesuits were still attached to it .
The sail was still unfurled , though there were a good many holes in it , as Langer had predicted would be the case by now .
It was a startling , almost numenous sight ; ;
but even more awesome was the fact that it was trailing an enormous comet's-tail of Angels .
The skiff was not heading for the nursery , however .
It seemed unlikely that her crew , if either of them were alive , could even see the Ariadne , for they were passing her at a distance of nearly a light-year .
And there would be no chance of signaling them -- without the Nernst generator Jack could not send a call powerful enough to get through all the static , and by the time he could rebuild his fusion power the skiff would be gone .
Fuming , helpless , he watched them pass him .
The sail , ragged though it was , still had enough surface to catch some of the ocean of power being poured out from the nursery stars .
He would never have believed , without seeing it , that the bizarre little vessel could go so fast .
But where was it going ? ?
And why was it causing so much agitation among the Angels , and being followed by so many of them ? ?
There was only one possible answer , but Jack's horrified mind refused to believe it until he had fed the radar plots of the skiff's course into the computer .
The curve on the card the computer spat back at him couldn't be argued with , however .
The skiff was headed for the very center of the nebula -- toward that place which , Jack knew now , could hold nothing less important than the very core of the Angel's life and religion .
It was clear that Langer had at last found a way to attract the Angel's attention .
It was equally clear that as of this moment , the treaty was off .
Stern chase 10
Langer would have to be headed off , whether he knew where he was going or not .
Almost surely he did ; ;
after all , he had had the same set of facts as Jack had had to work from , and he was an almost frighteningly observant man .
But not having talked to the Angels , he had made a wrong turn in his reasoning somewhere along the line .
Had he decided , perhaps , that the center of the cloud was a center of government , instead of a center of life and faith '' ? ?
But it didn't matter now whether he meant to invade the Holy of Holies , or was simply headed in that direction by accident .
If it was intentional , it was now also unnecessary ; ;
and whether intentional or not , the outcome would be disastrous .
Jack crawled under the boards and restored the six feet of lead line he had excised from the Nernst generator switch .
When he was back on his feet again and about to reinstall the fuses , however , he hesitated .
He had to have fusion power to catch up with the skiff , and he had to have it fast .
But fusion power in the Coal Sack was what had triggered all the trouble in the first place -- and he already had an Angel aboard .
`` Hesperus '' ? ?
`` Receiving '' .
`` I'm going to turn my generator back on , as I promised to do .
But I can't take you to Earth yet .
First I've got to intercept my brothers before they get any deeper into trouble .
Will you obstruct this , or will you help ? ?
I know it's not part of the bargain , and your elders might not like it '' .
`` Nobody else can live in your hearth while I am in it '' , Hesperus said promptly .
`` As for my elders , they have already admitted that they were wrong .
If because of this incident they become angry with Earth , I will not be permitted to go there at all .
Therefore of course I will help '' .
With a short-lived sigh of relief , Jack plugged the fuses back in and threw the switch .
Without an instant's transition , the green light that meant full fusion power winked on the board .
Always before , it had taken five minutes to --
Of course .
Hesperus was in there .
From here on out , the Ariadne was going to be hotter than any space cruiser man had ever dreamed of .
But since he had failed to anticipate it , he lost the five minutes anyhow , in plotting an intercept orbit .
`` Hesperus , don't use this t-tau vector trick of yours , please .
Ryan hefted his bulk up and supported it on one elbow .
He rubbed his eyes sleepily with one huge paw .
`` Ekstrohm , Nogol , you guys okay '' ? ?
`` Nothing wrong with me that couldn't be cured '' , Nogol said .
He didn't say what would cure him ; ;
he had been explaining all during the trip what he needed to make him feel like himself .
His small black eyes darted inside the olive oval of his face .
`` Ekstrohm '' ? ?
Ryan insisted .
`` Okay '' .
`` Well , let's take a ground-level look at the country around here '' .
The facsiport rolled open on the landscape .
A range of bluffs hugged the horizon , the color of decaying moss .
Above them , the sky was the black of space , or the almost equal black of the winter sky above Minneapolis , seen against neon-lit snow .
That cold , empty sky was full of fire and light .
It seemed almost a magnification of the Galaxy itself , of the Milky Way , blown up by some master photographer .
This fiery swath was actually only a belt of minor planets , almost like the asteroid belt in the original Solar System .
These planets were much bigger , nearly all capable of holding an atmosphere .
But to the infuriation of scientists , for no known reason not all of them did .
This would be the fifth mapping expedition to the planetoids of Yancy-6 in three generations .
They lay months away from the nearest Earth star by jump drive , and no one knew what they were good for , although it was felt that they would probably be good for something if it could only be discovered -- much like the continent of Antarctica in ancient history .
`` How can a planet with so many neighbors be so lonely '' ? ?
Ryan asked .
He was the captain , so he could ask questions like that .
`` Some can be lonely in a crowd '' , Nogol said elaborately .
`` What will we need outside , Ryan '' ? ?
Ekstrohm asked .
`` No helmets '' , the captain answered .
`` We can breathe out there , all right .
It just won't be easy .
This old world lost all of its helium and trace gases long ago .
Nitrogen and oxygen are about it '' .
`` Ryan , look over there '' , Nogol said .
`` Animals .
Ringing the ship .
Think they're intelligent , maybe hostile '' ? ?
`` I think they're dead '' , Ekstrohm interjected quietly .
`` I get no readings from them at all .
Sonic , electronic , galvanic -- all blank .
According to these needles , they're stone dead '' .
`` Ekstrohm , you and I will have a look '' , Ryan said .
`` You hold down the fort , Nogol .
Take it easy '' .
`` Easy '' , Nogol confirmed .
`` I heard a story once about a rookie who got excited when the captain stepped outside and he couldn't get an encephalographic reading on him .
Me , I know the mind of an officer works in a strange and unfathomable manner '' .
`` I'm not worried about you mis-reading the dials , Nogol , just about a lug like you reading them at all .
Remember , when the little hand is straight up that's negative .
Positive results start when it goes towards the hand you use to make your mark '' .
`` But I'm ambidextrous '' .
Ryan told him what he could do then .
Ekstrohm smiled , and followed the captain through the airlock with only a glance at the lapel gauge on his coverall .
The strong negative field his suit set up would help to repel bacteria and insects .
Actually , the types of infection that could attack a warm-blooded mammal were not infinite , and over the course of the last few hundred years adequate defenses had been found for all basic categories .
He wasn't likely to come down with hot chills and puzzling striped fever .
They ignored the ladder down to the planet surface and , with only a glance at the seismological gauge to judge surface resistance , dropped to the ground .
It was day , but in the thin atmosphere contrasts were sharp between light and shadow .
They walked from midnight to noon , noon to midnight , and came to the beast sprawled on its side .
Ekstrohm nudged it with a boot .
`` Hey , this is pretty close to a wart-hog '' .
`` Uh-huh '' , Ryan admitted .
`` One of the best matches I've ever found .
Well , it has to happen .
Statistical average and all .
Still , it sometimes gives you a creepy feeling to find a rabbit or a snapping turtle on some strange world .
It makes you wonder if this exploration business isn't all some big joke , and somebody has been everywhere before you even started '' .
The surveyor looked sidewise at the captain .
The big man seldom gave out with such thoughts .
Ekstrohm cleared his throat .
`` What shall we do with this one ? ?
Dissect it '' ? ?
Ryan nudged it with his toe , following Ekstrohm's example .
`` I don't know , Stormy .
It sure as hell doesn't look like any dominant intelligent species to me .
No hands , for one thing .
Of course , that's not definite proof '' .
`` No , it isn't '' , Ekstrohm said .
`` I think we'd better let it lay until we get a clearer picture of the ecological setup around here .
In the meantime , we might be thinking on the problem all these dead beasts represent .
What killed them '' ? ?
`` It looks like we did , when we made blastdown '' .
`` But what about our landing was lethal to the creatures '' ? ?
`` Radiation '' ? ?
Ekstrohm suggested .
`` The planet is very low in radiation from mineral deposits , and the atmosphere seems to shield out most of the solar output .
Any little dose of radiation might knock off these critters '' .
`` I don't know about that .
Maybe it would work the other way .
Maybe because they have had virtually no radioactive exposure and don't have any R's stored up , they could take a lot without harm '' .
`` Then maybe it was the shockwave we set up .
Or maybe it's sheer xenophobia .
They curl up and die at the sight of something strange and alien -- like a spaceship '' .
`` Maybe '' , the captain admitted .
`` At this stage of the game anything could be possible .
But there's one possibility I particularly don't like '' .
`` And that is '' ? ?
`` Suppose it was not us that killed these aliens .
Suppose it is something right on the planet , native to it .
I just hope it doesn't work on Earthmen too .
These critters went real sudden '' .
Ekstrohm lay in his bunk and thought , the camp is quiet .
The Earthmen made camp outside the spaceship .
There was no reason to leave the comfortable quarters inside the ship , except that , faced with a possibility of sleeping on solid ground , they simply had to get out .
The camp was a cluster of aluminum bubbles , ringed with a spy web to alert the Earthmen to the approach of any being .
Each man had a bubble to himself , privacy after the long period of enforced intimacy on board the ship .
Ekstrohm lay in his bunk and listened to the sounds of the night on Yancey-6 138 .
There was a keening of wind , and a cracking of the frozen ground .
Insects there were on the world , but they were frozen solid during the night , only to revive and thaw in the morning sun .
The bunk he lay on was much more uncomfortable than the acceleration couches on board .
Yet he knew the others were sleeping more soundly , now that they had renewed their contact with the matter that had birthed them to send them riding high vacuum .
Ekstrohm was not asleep .
Now there could be an end to pretending .
He threw off the light blanket and swung his feet off the bunk , to the floor .
Ekstrohm stood up .
There was no longer any need to hide .
But what was there to do ? ?
What had changed for him ? ?
He no longer had to lie in his bunk all night , his eyes closed , pretending to sleep .
In privacy he could walk around , leave the light on , read .
It was small comfort for insomnia .
Ekstrohm never slept .
Some doctors had informed him he was mistaken about this .
Actually , they said , he did sleep , but so shortly and fitfully that he forgot .
Others admitted he was absolutely correct -- he never slept .
His body processes only slowed down enough for him to dispell fatigue poisons .
Occasionally he fell into a waking , gritty-eyed stupor ; ;
but he never slept .
Never at all .
Naturally , he couldn't let his shipmates know this .
Insomnia would ground him from the Exploration Service , on physiological if not psychological grounds .
He had to hide it .
Over the years , he had had buddies in space in whom he thought he could confide .
The buddies invariably took advantage of him .
Since he couldn't sleep anyway , he might as well stand their watches for them or write their reports .
Where the hell did he get off threatening to report any laxness on their part to the captain ? ?
A man with insomnia had better avoid bad dreams of that kind if he knew what was good for him .
Ekstrohm had to hide his secret .
In a camp , instead of shipboard , hiding the secret was easier .
But the secret itself was just as hard .
Ekstrohm picked up a lightweight no-back from the ship's library , a book by Bloch , the famous twentieth century expert on sex .
He scanned a few lines on the social repercussions of a celebrated nineteenth century sex murderer , but he couldn't seem to concentrate on the weighty , pontifical , ponderous style .
On impulse , he flipped up the heat control on his coverall and slid back the hatch of the bubble .
Ekstrohm walked through the alien glass and looked up at the unfamiliar constellations , smelling the frozen sterility of the thin air .
Behind him , his mates stirred without waking .
Ekstrohm was startled in the morning by a banging on the hatch of his bubble .
It took him a few seconds to put his thoughts in order , and then he got up from the bunk where he had been resting , sleeplessly .
The angry burnt-red face of Ryan greeted him .
`` Okay , Stormy , this isn't the place for fun and games .
What did you do with them '' ? ?
`` Do with what '' ? ?
`` The dead beasties .
All the dead animals laying around the ship '' .
`` What are you talking about , Ryan ? ?
What do you think I did with them '' ? ?
`` I don't know .
All I know is that they are gone '' .
`` Gone '' ? ?
Ekstrohm shouldered his way outside and scanned the veldt .
There was no ring of animal corpses .
Nothing .
Nothing but wispy grass whipping in the keen breeze .
`` I'll be damned '' , Ekstrohm said .
`` You are right now , buddy .
ExPe doesn't like anybody mucking up primary evidence '' .
`` Where do you get off , Ryan '' ? ?
Ekstrohm demanded .
`` Why pick me for your patsy ? ?
This has got to be some kind of local phenomenon .
Why accuse a shipmate of being behind this '' ? ?
`` Listen , Ekstrohm , I want to give you the benefit of every doubt .
But you aren't exactly the model of a surveyor , you know .
You've been riding on a pink ticket for six years , you know that '' .
`` No '' , Ekstrohm said , `` No , I didn't know that '' .
`` You've been hiding things from me and Nogol every jump we've made with you .
Now comes this ! !
It fits the pattern of secrecy and stealth you've been involved in '' .
`` What could I do with your lousy dead bodies ? ?
What would I want with them '' ? ?
`` All I know is that you were outside the bubbles last night , and you were the only sentient being who came in or out of our alarm web .
The tapes show that .
Now all the bodies are missing , like they got up and walked away '' .
It was not a new experience to Ekstrohm .
No .
Suspicion wasn't new to him at all .
`` Ryan , there are other explanations for the disappearance of the bodies .
Look for them , will you ? ?
I give you my word I'm not trying to pull some stupid kind of joke , or to deliberately foul up the expedition .
Take my word , can't you '' ? ?
Ryan shook his head .
`` I don't think I can .
There's still such a thing as mental illness .
You may not be responsible '' .
Ekstrohm scowled .
`` Don't try anything violent , Stormy .
I outweigh you fifty pounds and I'm fast for a big man '' .
`` I wasn't planning on jumping you .
Why do you have to jump me the first time something goes wrong ? ?
She lived and was given a name .
Helva .
For her first three vegetable months she waved her crabbed claws , kicked weakly with her clubbed feet and enjoyed the usual routine of the infant .
She was not alone for there were three other such children in the big city's special nursery .
Soon they all were removed to Central Laboratory School where their delicate transformation began .
One of the babies died in the initial transferral but of Helva's `` class '' , seventeen thrived in the metal shells .
Instead of kicking feet , Helva's neural responses started her wheels ; ;
instead of grabbing with hands , she manipulated mechanical extensions .
As she matured , more and more neural synapses would be adjusted to operate other mechanisms that went into the maintenance and running of a space ship .
For Helva was destined to be the `` brain '' half of a scout ship , partnered with a man or a woman , whichever she chose , as the mobile half .
She would be among the elite of her kind .
Her initial intelligence tests registered above normal and her adaptation index was unusually high .
As long as her development within her shell lived up to expectations , and there were no side-effects from the pituitary tinkering , Helva would live a rewarding , rich and unusual life , a far cry from what she would have faced as an ordinary , `` normal '' being .
However , no diagram of her brain patterns , no early I.Q. tests recorded certain essential facts about Helva that Central must eventually learn .
They would have to bide their official time and see , trusting that the massive doses of shell-psychology would suffice her , too , as the necessary bulwark against her unusual confinement and the pressures of her profession .
A ship run by a human brain could not run rogue or insane with the power and resources Central had to build into their scout ships .
Brain ships were , of course , long past the experimental stages .
Most babes survived the techniques of pituitary manipulation that kept their bodies small , eliminating the necessity of transfers from smaller to larger shells .
And very , very few were lost when the final connection was made to the control panels of ship or industrial combine .
Shell people resembled mature dwarfs in size whatever their natal deformities were , but the well-oriented brain would not have changed places with the most perfect body in the Universe .
So , for happy years , Helva scooted around in her shell with her classmates , playing such games as Stall , Power-Seek , studying her lessons in trajectory , propulsion techniques , computation , logistics , mental hygiene , basic alien psychology , philology , space history , law , traffic , codes : all the et ceteras that eventually became compounded into a reasoning , logical , informed citizen .
Not so obvious to her , but of more importance to her teachers , Helva ingested the precepts of her conditioning as easily as she absorbed her nutrient fluid .
She would one day be grateful to the patient drone of the sub-conscious-level instruction .
Helva's civilization was not without busy , do-good associations , exploring possible inhumanities to terrestrial as well as extraterrestrial citizens .
One such group got all incensed over shelled `` children '' when Helva was just turning fourteen .
When they were forced to , Central Worlds shrugged its shoulders , arranged a tour of the Laboratory Schools and set the tour off to a big start by showing the members case histories , complete with photographs .
Very few committees ever looked past the first few photos .
Most of their original objections about `` shells '' were overridden by the relief that these hideous ( to them ) bodies were mercifully concealed .
Helva's class was doing Fine Arts , a selective subject in her crowded program .
She had activated one of her microscopic tools which she would later use for minute repairs to various parts of her control panel .
Her subject was large -- a copy of the Last Supper -- and her canvas , small -- the head of a tiny screw .
She had tuned her sight to the proper degree .
As she worked she absentmindedly crooned , producing a curious sound .
Shell people used their own vocal cords and diaphragms but sound issued through microphones rather than mouths .
Helva's hum then had a curious vibrancy , a warm , dulcet quality even in its aimless chromatic wanderings .
`` Why , what a lovely voice you have '' , said one of the female visitors .
Helva `` looked '' up and caught a fascinating panorama of regular , dirty craters on a flaky pink surface .
Her hum became a gurgle of surprise .
She instinctively regulated her `` sight '' until the skin lost its cratered look and the pores assumed normal proportions .
`` Yes , we have quite a few years of voice training , madam '' , remarked Helva calmly .
`` Vocal peculiarities often become excessively irritating during prolonged intra-stellar distances and must be eliminated .
I enjoyed my lessons '' .
Although this was the first time that Helva had seen unshelled people , she took this experience calmly .
Any other reaction would have been reported instantly .
`` I meant that you have a nice singing voice dear '' , the lady amended .
`` Thank you .
Would you like to see my work '' ? ?
Helva asked , politely .
She instinctively sheered away from personal discussions but she filed the comment away for further meditation .
`` Work '' ? ?
Asked the lady .
`` I am currently reproducing the Last Supper on the head of a screw '' .
`` No , I say '' , the lady twittered .
Helva turned her vision back to magnification and surveyed her copy critically .
`` Of course , some of my color values do not match the old Master's and the perspective is faulty but I believe it to be a fair copy '' .
The lady's eyes , unmagnified , bugged out .
`` Oh , I forget '' , and Helva's voice was really contrite .
If she could have blushed , she would have .
`` You people don't have adjustable vision '' .
The monitor of this discourse grinned with pride and amusement as Helva's tone indicated pity for the unfortunate .
`` Here , this will help '' , suggested Helva , substituting a magnifying device in one extension and holding it over the picture .
In a kind of shock , the ladies and gentlemen of the committee bent to observe the incredibly copied and brilliantly executed Last Supper on the head of a screw .
`` Well '' , remarked one gentleman who had been forced to accompany his wife , `` the good Lord can eat where angels fear to tread '' .
`` Are you referring , sir '' , asked Helva politely , `` to the Dark Age discussions of the number of angels who could stand on the head of a pin '' ? ?
`` I had that in mind '' .
`` If you substitute ' atom ' for ' angel ' , the problem is not insoluble , given the metallic content of the pin in question '' .
`` Which you are programed to compute '' ? ?
`` Of course '' .
`` Did they remember to program a sense of humor , as well , young lady '' ? ?
`` We are directed to develop a sense of proportion , sir , which contributes the same effect '' .
The good man chortled appreciatively and decided the trip was worth his time .
If the investigation committee spent months digesting the thoughtful food served them at the Laboratory School , they left Helva with a morsel as well .
`` Singing '' as applicable to herself required research .
She had , of course , been exposed to and enjoyed a music appreciation course which had included the better known classical works such as `` Tristan und Isolde '' , `` Candide '' , `` Oklahoma '' , `` Nozze de Figaro '' , the atomic age singers , Eileen Farrell , Elvis Presley and Geraldine Todd , as well as the curious rhythmic progressions of the Venusians , Capellan visual chromatics and the sonic concerti of the Altairians .
But `` singing '' for any shell person posed considerable technical difficulties to be overcome .
Shell people were schooled to examine every aspect of a problem or situation before making a prognosis .
Balanced properly between optimism and practicality , the nondefeatist attitude of the shell people led them to extricate themselves , their ships and personnel , from bizarre situations .
Therefore to Helva , the problem that she couldn't open her mouth to sing , among other restrictions , did not bother her .
She would work out a method , by-passing her limitations , whereby she could sing .
She approached the problem by investigating the methods of sound reproduction through the centuries , human and instrumental .
Her own sound production equipment was essentially more instrumental than vocal .
Breath control and the proper enunciation of vowel sounds within the oral cavity appeared to require the most development and practice .
Shell people did not , strictly speaking , breathe .
For their purposes , oxygen and other gases were not drawn from the surrounding atmosphere through the medium of lungs but sustained artificially by solution in their shells .
After experimentation , Helva discovered that she could manipulate her diaphragmic unit to sustain tone .
By relaxing the throat muscles and expanding the oral cavity well into the frontal sinuses , she could direct the vowel sounds into the most felicitous position for proper reproduction through her throat microphone .
She compared the results with tape recordings of modern singers and was not unpleased although her own tapes had a peculiar quality about them , not at all unharmonious , merely unique .
Acquiring a repertoire from the Laboratory library was no problem to one trained to perfect recall .
She found herself able to sing any role and any song which struck her fancy .
It would not have occurred to her that it was curious for a female to sing bass , baritone , tenor , alto , mezzo , soprano and coloratura as she pleased .
It was , to Helva , only a matter of the correct reproduction and diaphragmic control required by the music attempted .
If the authorities remarked on her curious avocation , they did so among themselves .
Shell people were encouraged to develop a hobby so long as they maintained proficiency in their technical work .
On the anniversary of her sixteenth year in her shell , Helva was unconditionally graduated and installed in her ship , the Aj .
Her permanent titanium shell was recessed behind an even more indestructible barrier in the central shaft of the scout ship .
The neural , audio , visual and sensory connections were made and sealed .
Her extendibles were diverted , connected or augmented and the final , delicate-beyond-description brain taps were completed while Helva remained anesthetically unaware of the proceedings .
When she awoke , she was the ship .
Her brain and intelligence controlled every function from navigation to such loading as a scout ship of her class needed .
She could take care of herself and her ambulatory half , in any situation already recorded in the annals of Central Worlds and any situation its most fertile minds could imagine .
Her first actual flight , for she and her kind had made mock flights on dummy panels since she was eight , showed her complete mastery of the techniques of her profession .
She was ready for her great adventures and the arrival of her mobile partner .
There were nine qualified scouts sitting around collecting base pay the day Helva was commissioned .
There were several missions which demanded instant attention but Helva had been of interest to several department heads in Central for some time and each man was determined to have her assigned to his section .
Consequently no one had remembered to introduce Helva to the prospective partners .
The ship always chose its own partner .
Had there been another `` brain '' ship at the Base at the moment , Helva would have been guided to make the first move .
As it was , while Central wrangled among itself , Robert Tanner sneaked out of the pilots' barracks , out to the field and over to Helva's slim metal hull .
`` Hello , anyone at home '' ? ?
Tanner wisecracked .
`` Of course '' , replied Helva logically , activating her outside scanners .
`` Are you my partner '' ? ?
She asked hopefully , as she recognized the Scout Service uniform .
`` All you have to do is ask '' , he retorted hopefully .
`` No one has come .
I thought perhaps there were no partners available and I've had no directives from Central '' .
Even to herself Helva sounded a little self-pitying but the truth was she was lonely , sitting on the darkened field .
Always she had had the company of other shells and more recently , technicians by the score .
The sudden solitude had lost its momentary charm and become oppressive .
`` No directives from Central is scarcely a cause for regret , but there happen to be eight other guys biting their fingernails to the quick just waiting for an invitation to board you , you beautiful thing '' .
It would have killed you in the cabin .
Do you have anything for me '' ? ?
Mercer stammered , not knowing what B'dikkat meant , and the two-nosed man answered for him , `` I think he has a nice baby head , but it isn't big enough for you to take yet '' .
Mercer never noticed the needle touch his arm .
B'dikkat had turned to the next knot of people when the super-condamine hit Mercer .
He tried to run after B'dikkat , to hug the lead spacesuit , to tell B'dikkat that he loved him .
He stumbled and fell , but it did not hurt .
The many-bodied girl lay near him .
Mercer spoke to her .
`` Isn't it wonderful ? ?
You're beautiful , beautiful , beautiful .
I'm so happy to be here '' .
The woman covered with growing hands came and sat beside them .
She radiated warmth and good fellowship .
Mercer thought that she looked very distinguished and charming .
He struggled out of his clothes .
It was foolish and snobbish to wear clothing when none of these nice people did .
The two women babbled and crooned at him .
With one corner of his mind he knew that they were saying nothing , just expressing the euphoria of a drug so powerful that the known universe had forbidden it .
With most of his mind he was happy .
He wondered how anyone could have the good luck to visit a planet as nice as this .
He tried to tell the Lady Da , but the words weren't quite straight .
A painful stab hit him in the abdomen .
The drug went after the pain and swallowed it .
It was like the cap in the hospital , only a thousand times better .
The pain was gone , though it had been crippling the first time .
He forced himself to be deliberate .
He rammed his mind into focus and said to the two ladies who lay pinkly nude beside him in the desert , `` That was a good bite .
Maybe I will grow another head .
That would make B'dikkat happy '' ! !
The Lady Da forced the foremost of her bodies in an upright position .
Said she , `` I'm strong , too .
I can talk .
Remember , man , remember .
People never live forever .
We can die , too , we can die like real people .
I do so believe in death '' ! !
Mercer smiled at her through his happiness .
`` Of course you can .
But isn't this nice ''
With this he felt his lips thicken and his mind go slack .
He was wide awake , but he did not feel like doing anything .
In that beautiful place , among all those companionable and attractive people , he sat and smiled .
B'dikkat was sterilizing his knives .
Mercer wondered how long the super-condamine had lasted him .
He endured the ministrations of the dromozoa without screams or movement .
The agonies of nerves and itching of skin were phenomena which happened somewhere near him , but meant nothing .
He watched his own body with remote , casual interest .
The Lady Da and the hand-covered woman stayed near him .
After a long time the half-man dragged himself over to the group with his powerful arms .
Having arrived he blinked sleepily and friendlily at them , and lapsed back into the restful stupor from which he had emerged .
Mercer saw the sun rise on occasion , closed his eyes briefly , and opened them to see stars shining .
Time had no meaning .
The dromozoa fed him in their mysterious way ; ;
the drug canceled out his needs for cycles of the body .
At last he noticed a return of the inwardness of pain .
The pains themselves had not changed ; ;
he had .
He knew all the events which could take place on Shayol .
He remembered them well from his happy period .
Formerly he had noticed them -- now he felt them .
He tried to ask the Lady Da how long they had had the drug , and how much longer they would have to wait before they had it again .
She smiled at him with benign , remote happiness ; ;
apparently her many torsos , stretched out along the ground , had a greater capacity for retaining the drug than did his body .
She meant him well , but was in no condition for articulate speech .
The half-man lay on the ground , arteries pulsating prettily behind the half-transparent film which protected his abdominal cavity .
Mercer squeezed the man's shoulder .
The half-man woke , recognized Mercer and gave him a healthily sleepy grin .
`` ' A good morrow to you , my boy .
That's out of a play .
Did you ever see a play '' ? ?
`` You mean a game with cards '' ? ?
`` No '' , said the half-man , `` a sort of eye-machine with real people doing the figures '' .
`` I never saw that '' , said Mercer , `` but I '' --
`` But you want to ask me when B'dikkat is going to come back with the needle '' .
`` Yes '' , said Mercer , a little ashamed of his obviousness .
`` Soon '' , said the half-man .
That's why I think of plays .
We all know what is going to happen .
We all know when it is going to happen .
We all know what the dummies will do '' -- he gestured at the hummocks in which the decorticated men were cradled -- `` and we all know what the new people will ask .
But we never know how long a scene is going to take '' .
`` What's a ' scene ' '' ? ?
Asked Mercer .
`` Is that the name for the needle '' ? ?
The half-man laughed with something close to real humor .
`` No , no , no .
You've got the lovelies on the brain .
A scene is just a part of a play .
I mean we know the order in which things happen , but we have no clocks and nobody cares enough to count days or to make calendars and there's not much climate here , so none of us know how long anything takes .
The pain seems short and the pleasure seems long .
I'm inclined to think that they are about two Earth-weeks each '' .
Mercer did not know what an `` Earth-week '' was , since he had not been a well-read man before his conviction , but he got nothing more from the half-man at that time .
The half-man received a dromozootic implant , turned red in the face , shouted senselessly at Mercer , `` Take it out , you fool ! !
Take it out of me '' ! !
When Mercer looked on helplessly , the half-man twisted over on his side , his pink dusty back turned to Mercer , and wept hoarsely and quietly to himself .
Mercer himself could not tell how long it was before B'dikkat came back .
It might have been several days .
It might have been several months .
Once again B'dikkat moved among them like a father ; ;
once again they clustered like children .
This time B'dikkat smiled pleasantly at the little head which had grown out of Mercer's thigh -- a sleeping child's head , covered with light hair on top and with dainty eyebrows over the resting eyes .
Mercer got the blissful needle .
When B'dikkat cut the head from Mercer's thigh , he felt the knife grinding against the cartilage which held the head to his own body .
He saw the child-face grimace as the head was cut ; ;
he felt the far , cool flash of unimportant pain , as B'dikkat dabbed the wound with a corrosive antiseptic which stopped all bleeding immediately .
The next time it was two legs growing from his chest .
Then there had been another head beside his own .
Or was that after the torso and legs , waist to toe-tips , of the little girl which had grown from his side ? ?
He forgot the order .
He did not count time .
Lady Da smiled at him often , but there was no love in this place .
She had lost the extra torsos .
In between teratologies , she was a pretty and shapely woman ; ;
but the nicest thing about their relationship was her whisper to him , repeated some thousands of time , repeated with smiles and hope , `` People never live forever '' .
She found this immensely comforting , even though Mercer did not make much sense out of it .
Thus events occurred , and victims changed in appearance , and new ones arrived .
Sometimes B'dikkat took the new ones , resting in the everlasting sleep of their burned-out brains , in a ground-truck to be added to other herds .
The bodies in the truck threshed and bawled without human speech when the dromozoa struck them .
Finally , Mercer did manage to follow B'dikkat to the door of the cabin .
He had to fight the bliss of super-condamine to do it .
Only the memory of previous hurt , bewilderment and perplexity made him sure that if he did not ask B'dikkat when he , Mercer , was happy , the answer would no longer be available when he needed it .
Fighting pleasure itself , he begged B'dikkat to check the records and to tell him how long he had been there .
B'dikkat grudgingly agreed , but he did not come out of the doorway .
He spoke through the public address box built into the cabin , and his gigantic voice roared out over the empty plain , so that the pink herd of talking people stirred gently in their happiness and wondered what their friend B'dikkat might be wanting to tell them .
When he said it , they thought it exceedingly profound , though none of them understood it , since it was simply the amount of time that Mercer had been on Shayol :
`` Standard years -- eighty-four years , seven months , three days , two hours , eleven and one half minutes .
Good luck , fellow '' .
Mercer turned away .
The secret little corner of his mind , which stayed sane through happiness and pain , made him wonder about B'dikkat .
What persuaded the cow-man to remain on Shayol ? ?
What kept him happy without super-condamine ? ?
Was B'dikkat a crazy slave to his own duty or was he a man who had hopes of going back to his own planet some day , surrounded by a family of little cow-people resembling himself ? ?
Mercer , despite his happiness , wept a little at the strange fate of B'dikkat .
His own fate he accepted .
He remembered the last time he had eaten -- actual eggs from an actual pan .
The dromozoa kept him alive , but he did not know how they did it .
He staggered back to the group .
The Lady Da , naked in the dusty plain , waved a hospitable hand and showed that there was a place for him to sit beside her .
There were unclaimed square miles of seating space around them , but he appreciated the kindliness of her gesture none the less .
4 ,
The years , if they were years , went by .
The land of Shayol did not change .
Sometimes the bubbling sound of geysers came faintly across the plain to the herd of men ; ;
those who could talk declared it to be the breathing of Captain Alvarez .
There was night and day , but no setting of crops , no change of season , no generations of men .
Time stood still for these people , and their load of pleasure was so commingled with the shocks and pains of the dromozoa that the words of the Lady Da took on very remote meaning .
`` People never live forever '' .
Her statement was a hope , not a truth in which they could believe .
They did not have the wit to follow the stars in their courses , to exchange names with each other , to harvest the experience of each for the wisdom of all .
There was no dream of escape for these people .
Though they saw the old-style chemical rockets lift up from the field beyond B'dikkat's cabin , they did not make plans to hide among the frozen crop of transmuted flesh .
Far long ago , some other prisoner than one of these had tried to write a letter .
His handwriting was on a rock .
Mercer read it , and so had a few of the others , but they could not tell which man had done it .
Nor did they care .
The letter , scraped on stone , had been a message home .
They could still read the opening : `` Once , I was like you , stepping out of my window at the end of day , and letting the winds blow me gently toward the place I lived in .
Once , like you , I had one head , two hands , ten fingers on my hands .
The front part of my head was called a face , and I could talk with it .
Now I can only write , and that only when I get out of pain .
Dan Morgan told himself he would forget Ann Turner .
He was well rid of her .
He certainly didn't want a wife who was fickle as Ann .
If he had married her , he'd have been asking for trouble .
But all of this was rationalization .
Sometimes he woke up in the middle of the night thinking of Ann , and then could not get back to sleep .
His plans and dreams had revolved around her so much and for so long that now he felt as if he had nothing .
The easiest thing would be to sell out to Al Budd and leave the country , but there was a stubborn streak in him that wouldn't allow it .
The best antidote for the bitterness and disappointment that poisoned him was hard work .
He found that if he was tired enough at night , he went to sleep simply because he was too exhausted to stay awake .
Each day he found himself thinking less often of Ann ; ;
each day the hurt was a little duller , a little less poignant .
He had plenty of work to do .
Because the summer was unusually dry and hot , the spring produced a smaller stream than in ordinary years .
The grass in the meadows came fast , now that the warm weather was here .
He could not afford to lose a drop of the precious water , so he spent most of his waking hours along the ditches in his meadows .
He had no idea how much time Budd would give him .
In any case , he had no intention of being caught asleep , so he carried his revolver in its holster on his hip and he took his Winchester with him and leaned it against the fence .
He stopped every few minutes and leaned on his shovel as he studied the horizon , but nothing happened , each day dragging out with monotonous calm .
When , in late afternoon on the last day in June , he saw two people top the ridge to the south and walk toward the house , he quit work immediately and strode to his rifle .
It could be some kind of trick Budd had thought up .
No one walked in this country , least of all Ed Dow or Dutch Renfro or any of the rest of the Bar B crew .
Morgan watched the two figures for a time , puzzled .
When they were closer and he saw that one was a woman , he was more puzzled than ever .
He cleaned his shovel , left it against the fence , picked up his Winchester , and started downstream .
His visitors had crawled through the south fence and were crossing the meadow , angling toward the house .
Now he saw that both the man and woman were moving slowly and irregularly , staggering , as if they found it a struggle to remain on their feet .
Reaching the house ahead of them , he waited with his Winchester in his hands .
They crawled through the north fence and came on toward him , and now he saw that both were young , not more than nineteen or twenty .
They were dirty , their clothes were torn , and the girl was so exhausted that she fell when she was still twenty feet from the front door .
She lay there , making no effort to get back on her feet .
The boy came on to the porch and sat down , his gaze on Morgan as if half expecting him to shoot and not really caring .
Morgan hesitated , thinking that if this was a trick , it was a good one .
He didn't think it was possible for this couple to be pretending .
The boy licked his dry lips .
He asked , `` Could we have a drink '' ? ?
Morgan jerked his head toward the front door .
`` In the kitchen '' , he said .
Leaning his Winchester against the front of the house , he walked to the girl .
`` Get up .
There's water in the house '' .
She didn't move or say anything .
Her eyes were glazed as if she didn't hear or even see him .
She had reached a point at which she didn't even care how she looked .
Her face was very thin , and burned by the sun until much of the skin was dead and peeling , the new skin under it red and angry .
Her blond hair was frowzy , her dress torn in several places , and her shoes were so completely worn out that they were practically no protection .
It must have hurt her even to walk , for the sole was completely off her left foot and Morgan saw that it was bruised and bleeding .
He picked her up , sliding one hand under her shoulders , the other under her knees , and carried her into the house .
She was amazingly light , and so relaxed in his arms that he wasn't even sure she was conscious .
Any lingering suspicion that this was a trick Al Budd had thought up was dispelled .
No girl would go this far to fool a man so she could kill him .
Besides , she had a sweet face that attracted him .
He put her down on the couch , and going into the kitchen , saw that the boy had dropped into a chair beside the table .
They looked a good deal alike , Morgan thought .
Both had blonde hair and blue eyes , and there was even a faint similarity of features .
Morgan filled the dipper from the water bucket on the shelf , went back into the front room , lifted the girl's head , and held the edge of the dipper to her mouth .
She drank greedily , and murmured , `` Thank you '' , as he lowered her head .
He stood looking down at her for a moment , wondering what could have reduced her to this condition .
He had seen a few nester wagons go through the country , the families almost starving to death , but he had never seen any of them on foot and as bad off as these two .
The girl dropped off to sleep .
Morgan returned to the kitchen , built a fire , and carried in several buckets of water from the spring which he poured into the copper boiler that he had placed on the stove .
He brought his Winchester in from the front of the house , then faced the boy .
`` Who are you and what happened to you '' ? ?
He asked .
`` I'm Billy Jones '' , the boy answered .
`` That's my wife Sharon .
We ran out of money and we haven't eaten for two days '' .
`` What are you doing here '' ? ?
`` Are we in Wyoming '' ? ?
Morgan nodded .
`` About five miles north of the line '' .
Jones sighed as if relieved .
`` We've been looking for work , but all the ranchers have turned us down '' .
`` You mean you dragged your wife all over hell's half-acre looking for work '' ? ?
Morgan demanded .
`` The town of Buckhorn's only about six miles from here .
Why didn't you go there '' ? ?
`` We didn't want town work '' , Jones said .
`` This is a mighty empty country '' , Morgan said .
`` There's only one more ranch three miles north of here .
You'd have starved to death if you'd missed both places '' .
`` Then we're lucky we got here .
Could you give us a job , Mr. ''
`` Morgan .
Dan Morgan '' .
He was silent a moment , thinking he could use a man this time of year , and if the girl could cook , it would give him more time in the meadows , but he knew nothing about the couple .
They might kill him in his sleep , thinking there was money in the house .
He dismissed the possibility at once .
The girl's thin face haunted him .
It wasn't the face of a killer .
He wasn't so sure about the boy .
He hadn't shaved for several weeks , his sparse beard giving his face a pathetic , woebegone expression .
There was more to this than Jones had told him .
They were running from something .
He'd be an idiot to let them stay he thought , but he couldn't send them on , either .
`` I could use some help '' , Morgan said finally , `` but I can't afford to pay you anything .
I guess you'd better go on in the morning '' .
`` We'll work for our keep '' , the boy said eagerly .
`` I've been mucking in a mine in the San Juan , but I used to work on a ranch .
Sharon , she's cooked in a restaurant .
We'll work hard , Mr. Morgan '' .
`` I'll see '' , Morgan said .
`` Right now you need a meal and a bath .
Your wife's in terrible shape '' .
`` I know '' , Jones said dejectedly .
Morgan filled the fire box with wood again , then started supper and set the table .
When the meal was ready , he told Jones to wash up , and going into the front room , woke the girl .
He said , `` I've got some supper ready '' .
She rubbed her eyes and stretched , then sat up , her hands going to her hair .
`` I'm a mess '' , she said , and suddenly she was alarmed .
`` Who are you ? ?
How did we get here '' ? ?
`` I'm Dan Morgan .
This is the Rafter Aj .
You fell down in front of the house , and I carried you in .
I gave you a drink and then you went to sleep '' .
`` Oh '' .
She stared at him , her eyes wide as she thought about what he had said ; ;
then she murmured : `` You're very kind , Mr. Morgan .
Do you take in all the strays who come by '' ? ?
`` I don't have many strays coming to my front door '' , he said .
`` Think you can walk to the table '' ? ?
`` Of course '' .
She got to her feet , staggered , and almost fell .
He caught her by an arm and helped her into the kitchen .
She sat down at the table , shaking her head .
`` I'm sorry , Mr. Morgan .
I'm usually a very strong woman , but I'm awfully tired '' .
`` And hungry '' , he said .
`` Start in .
It's not much of a meal , but it's what I eat '' .
`` Not much of a meal '' ? ?
The girl cried .
`` Mr. Morgan , it's the best-looking food I ever saw '' .
He told himself he had never seen two people eat so much .
When they were finally satisfied , Jones said , `` I think he's going to give us work '' .
The grateful way she looked at Morgan made him ashamed of himself .
When he saw the expression in her eyes , he knew he couldn't send them on .
She said , `` I guess the Lord looks out for fools , drunkards , and innocents '' .
Morgan laughed .
`` Which are you '' ? ?
`` We're not drunkards '' , she said .
`` That's all I'm sure of '' .
She helped him with the dishes , then he brought more water in from the spring before it got dark .
He carried the tub from the back of the house where it hung from a nail in the wall .
He said : `` You'll feel a lot better after you have a bath .
Your feet are in bad shape , Mrs. Jones .
You'll have to go to town to see the doc '' .
`` No , she'll be all right '' , Jones said quickly .
`` I mean , we don't have any way to get there and we can't expect you to quit work just to take us to town '' .
`` We'll see '' , Morgan said .
`` Could you find me a needle and thread '' ? ?
The girl asked .
`` My dress needs some work on it '' .
He nodded and , going into the bedroom , brought a needle , thread , and scissors .
He said : `` I'm going to bed '' .
He nodded at the door in front of him .
`` That's my spare bedroom .
The bed isn't made , but you'll find plenty of blankets there '' .
`` You're awfully kind '' , the girl said .
`` We'll pay you back if you'll let us .
Some way '' .
`` It's all right '' , he said .
`` I get up early .
You'd better sleep '' .
Jones followed him into the front room , closing the door behind him .
He said : `` If it's all right with you , Mr. Morgan , I'll sleep out here on the couch .
We haven't slept together since we started .
I just can't take any chances on getting her pregnant , and if we were sleeping together ''
He stopped , embarrassed , and Morgan said , `` I understand that , but I don't savvy why you'd go off and leave your jobs in the first place '' .
`` We got fired '' , Jones said .
`` We had to do something '' .
They were a pair of lost , whipped kids , Morgan thought as he went to bed .
Gavin paused wearily .
`` You can't stay here with me .
It's late and you said they'd be here by dawn '' .
`` You can't make me go '' .
Gavin sank down again into his chair and began to rock .
He was thinking of Rittenhouse and how he had left him there , to rock to death on the porch of the Splendide .
It was the only thing in his life for which he felt guilt .
Beneath his black shirt his frail shoulders shook and croaks of pain broke from his throat , the stored pain shattering free in slow gasps , terrible to see .
Clayton tried to call back the face of the man he had known .
Against that other man he could rally his anger ; ;
against this bent man in the chair he was powerless .
Gavin's lips moved so that Clayton had to stoop to catch the words .
`` Do you remember Big Charlie '' ? ?
He whispered .
`` He stuck with me all these years .
Just a half-breed 'pache , never said much , never meant anythin to me , but he stuck with me .
He got into a fight with Tom English , your brother's son .
It was a fair fight , the boy provoked it -- Big Charlie told me so .
I believed him .
They killed Big Charlie , dumped his body in my rose garden two nights ago .
My men , they all left me .
Just cleared out .
I didn't understand why , Clay .
They just all cleared out .
I treated them fair ''
He wiped his lips with a sleeve , then stared at Clayton in a childish kind of wonder .
`` Do you mean '' -- he asked almost shyly -- `` you want me to go with you , wherever you're goin '' ? ?
`` Yes '' .
`` You don't hate me any more '' ? ?
Clayton choked , shook his head , murmuring , `` No '' .
`` Come here '' .
The old man beckoned with one finger and Clayton went forward to him .
Gavin slipped his arms around his chest and hugged him fiercely .
`` All my life '' , he said , `` I tried .
I tried .
I saw you driftin away -- but I tried .
And you wanted no part of me when I had so much to give .
Now there's nothin left of me .
Laurel is gone , my men are gone , Ed is dead -- and you come to me , to help me .
Oh ! !
God in Heaven , I can't refuse you now .
That would mock me too much ! !
Can't let you go way from me again '' He closed his eyes , ashamed of his tears .
`` I'll go , Clay '' .
Clayton freed himself from the embrace and stepped back .
The eyes followed him fearfully .
`` The horses .
There isn't much time .
I'll saddle the horses and bring them round .
You get ready ''
He burst from the hot confinement of the room into the cold night air .
Gavin's stallion was in the barn and he tightened the cinches over the saddle blanket , working by touch in the darkness , comforting the animal with easy words .
When he had finished he led him and the mare to the porch .
The stallion had smelled the mare coming into heat and began to paw the turf , shaking his head .
Clayton looped the reins in a knot over the veranda post and patted the warm flesh of his neck .
The mare had backed away .
`` You take it easy , boy '' , Clayton whispered .
`` She doesn't want you now .
You take it easy , your time will come '' .
Gavin stood on the porch , a thin figure .
He had taken a carbine down from the wall and it trailed from his hand , the stock bumping on the wood floor .
Clayton called to him and he came slowly down the steps .
`` Clay '' , he said , `` where are we goin '' ? ?
`` To a ranch in the valley .
There's someone there I have to see .
We may take her with us -- to California .
I don't know yet , it's crazy ; ;
I have to think about it .
But California is where we're goin '' .
`` California '' .
Gavin began to nod .
`` That's a new land .
A man could make a mark there .
Two men , together like us , we could do somethin fine out there , maybe find a place where no one's ever been .
Start out fresh , the two of us , like nothin had ever happened '' .
`` Yes , like a father and son '' .
`` I made you what you are '' , Gavin whispered .
`` I made you so you could stand up .
I made you a man '' .
`` Yes , Gavin , you did '' .
He approached the horse and laid a hand on the stallion's quivering neck .
`` Help me up , Clay .
Help me up , I feel kind of stiff '' .
Clayton lifted him gently into the saddle , like a child .
`` I hate to leave my garden '' , Gavin said .
`` They'll trample it down .
I loved my garden '' .
`` It will grow again -- in California '' .
`` I loved this valley '' , he whispered huskily .
`` Lived alone here for three years , before any man came .
Lived alone by the river .
It was nice then , so peaceful and quiet .
There was no one but me .
I don't want to leave it '' .
Clayton swung into the saddle and whacked the stallion's rump .
The two horses broke from the yard , from the circle of light cast by the lamp still burning in the house , into the darkness .
Thirty-five
they rode at a measured pace through the valley .
Dawn would come soon and the night was at its coldest .
The moon had sunk below the black crest of the mountains and the land , seen through eyes that had grown accustomed to the absence of light , looked primeval , as if no man had ever trespassed before .
It looked as Gavin had first seen it years ago , on those nights when he slept alone by his campfire and waked suddenly to the hoot of an owl or the rustle of a blade of grass in the moon's wind -- a savage land , untenanted and brooding , too strong to be broken by the will of men .
Gavin sighed bitterly .
In that inert landscape the caravan of his desires passed before his mind .
He saw them ambushed , strewn in the postures of the broken and the dying .
In vain his mind groped to reassemble the bones of the relationships he had sought so desperately , but they would not come to life .
The silence oppressed him , made him bend low over the horse's neck as if to hide from a wind that had begun to blow far away and was twisting slowly through the darkness in its slow search .
They passed ranches that were framed dark gray against the black hills .
Then at last the darkness began to dissolve .
A bold line of violet broke loose from the high ridge of the mountains , followed by feathers of red that swept the last stars from the sky .
The wan light spread over the ground and the valley revealed in the first glimmer the contours of trees and fences and palely shadowed gullies .
They had been seen as soon as they left the ranch , picked out of the darkness by the weary though watchful eyes of two men posted a few hundred yards away in the windless shelter of the trees .
The two men whipped their horses into town and flung themselves up the steps of the saloon , crying their intelligence .
The men in Pettigrew's were tired from a night's drinking , their faces red and baggy .
But the liquor had flushed their courage .
They greeted the news angrily , as though they had been cheated of purpose .
Lester heard their muttering , saw their eyes reveal their desire .
He worked his tongue round and round in the hollow of his cheek and his voice came out of his throat , dry and cracked .
`` He's leavin .
That's what you wanted , isn't it ? ?
Clayton is with him , takin him out of the valley .
You can't '' --
`` Keep out of this '' , Purvis snarled .
`` He's not your brother , he's Gavin's son .
You see , he lied to us when he said he was leavin alone '' .
Joe Purvis was thinking back many years .
First he thought of the time he had ridden to Gavin and told him how his cattle were being rustled at the far end of the valley .
He remembered Gavin's smirk , his own cringing feeling , his impotence .
Then he thought of a time when Clayton's horse had fallen lame in the Gap .
His wife had said to him : `` Nellie is in love with Clayton Roy .
He wouldn't even dance with her at Gavin's party .
He treats her like she was dirt .
And you stand by like a fool and let him do it ''
He remembered Clayton's mocking smile in the saloon when he had asked him what he would do if they brought their cattle to water .
It was the night Clayton had tricked them in the poker game .
`` You're Gavin's son '' , Joe Purvis had said .
He turned to Lester .
`` You brought him back to this valley thinkin he would help you find your boy .
He meant to help Gavin all the time .
He made a fool of you , Lester '' .
He swung round to the other men -- `` We can catch him easy ! !
There are plenty of fresh horses halfway at my place .
If we let them go , they won't stay away , they'll find men to ride with them and they'll be back .
There's only one way they can get out now and that's through the Gap -- if we ride hard we can take them '' .
Lester's hand fluttered to Cabot's shoulder .
The boy jerked away .
`` He killed Tom -- do you understand that '' ? ?
Cabot turned back to the men and he was drunk with the thing they would do , wild to break from the cloying warmth of the saloon into the cold of the ebbing night .
He fled through the door and down the steps , running , and the men grunted and followed , pushing Lester to one side where he backed against the wall with the sleeve of his jacket raised before his eyes to shut out the light .
Purvis and Silas Pettigrew were the last to leave .
They mounted up and rode slowly behind the others at a safe distance .
Thirty-six
in the cold dawn the mist swirled low to the ground , then rose with a gust of sudden wind to leave the valley clear .
The clouds parted and hard gashes of sunlight swooped down to stain the earth with streaks of white and gold light so that the shadows of the running horses flowed like dark streams over the dazzling snow .
When they turned in the saddle they could see the men behind them , strung out on the prairie in a flat black line .
The wind of their running was cold and wild , the horses were lathered and their manes streamed like stiff black pennants in the wind .
The mare began to tire and Clayton felt the spray of snow from the hoofs of Gavin's stallion .
He looked over his shoulder at the thin dotting of pursuers .
They neither gained nor fell back .
He rode low on the mare's neck .
Ahead of him Gavin turned slightly off the trail and pointed for the Gap , no more than a mile away .
Gavin's face was bloodless with excitement .
He did not look back ; ;
he could feel more than hear the staccato beat of hoofs that fanned out across the prairie to the north .
He knew who was riding after him -- the men he had known all his life , the men who had worked for him , sworn their loyalty to him .
Now they were riding to kill him .
And he was fleeing , running -- fleeing his death and his life at the same time .
The land over which he sped was the land he had created and lived in : his valley .
With every leaping stride of the horse beneath him he crossed one more patch of earth that had been his , that he would never see again .
The Gap looming before him -- the place where had confronted Jack English on that day so many years ago -- was his exit from all that had meaning to him .
California is too far , he thought .
He would never reach California .
He was too old -- when he passed up and through the corridor of pines that lined the trail he could see ahead , he was passing from life .
The sentry was not dead .
He was , in fact , showing signs of reviving .
He had been carrying an Enfield rifle and a holstered navy cap-and-ball pistol .
A bayonet hung in a belt scabbard .
He was partially uniformed in a cavalry tunic and hat .
Mike stripped these from him and donned them .
He and Dean tied and gagged the man , using his belt and shirt for the purpose .
They dragged him inside the building .
Fiske joined them , unsteady on his feet .
Julia , seeing the bandage , rushed to him .
`` You are hurt '' ! !
She breathed .
`` I never felt better in my life '' , Fiske blustered .
He turned to Susan and kissed her on the cheek .
`` Thank you , My dear '' , he said .
`` You are very brave '' .
Mike silenced them .
`` We'll talk later .
First , we've got to get out of here '' .
`` We'll grab horses '' , Dean said .
`` The main bunch is outside , but there are some over there inside the wall '' .
Mike debated it , trying to decide whether Fiske was strong enough to ride .
But it at least offered him a chance for living .
He had none here .
And , for the sake of Julia and Susan , it had to be tried .
The guerrilla bivouac remained silent .
Light showed in the orderly room across the parade ground .
Someone evidently was on duty there .
No doubt there would be men guarding the horses .
About a dozen animals were held inside the stockade , as best Mike could make out in the moonlight .
Evidently this was a precaution so that mounts would be available in an emergency .
He handed the guard's rifle to Fiske .
`` Dean and myself will try to cut out horses to ride '' , he said .
`` We'll stampede the rest .
You stay with the ladies .
All of you be ready to ride hell for leather '' .
He added , `` If this doesn't work out , the three of you barricade yourself in the house and talk terms with them '' .
He handed the bayonet to Dean and kept the pistol .
Susan halted Dean and kissed him .
She clung to him , talking to him , and dabbing at her eyes .
Mike turned away .
He was thinking that the way she had responded to his own kiss hadn't meant what he had believed it had .
He felt unutterably weary .
Dean turned from Susan and took Julia Fortune in his arms .
He kissed her also , and with deep tenderness .
She too began to weep .
He released her and joined Mike .
`` All right '' , he said .
Mike only said , `` Later '' .
`` Be careful , McLish '' ! !
Susan said fiercely .
`` The way you were careful '' ? ?
He snorted .
`` Running around in the moonlight almost naked and slugging a man with a rock '' ? ?
He kept going .
He wanted no more sentimental scenes with her .
He might say or do something foolish .
Something all of them would regret .
He might tell her how sorry a spectacle she was making of herself , pretending to be blind to the way Julia Fortune had taken Dean's affections from her .
And using him , Mike McLish , as a sop to her pride .
He handed the bayonet to Dean and kept the pistol .
`` Stay well back of me '' , he said .
`` I'm going to walk up to the horses , bold as brass , pretending I'm one of the guerrillas .
There's bound to be someone on guard , but the hat might fool them long enough for me to get close '' .
Holding the pistol concealed , he walked to the rear wall of the stockade .
It was pierced by a wagon gate built of two wings .
One wing stood open .
Mike passed through it and moved toward the dark mass of horses .
They were tethered , army style , on stable lines .
A voice spoke near-at-hand .
`` Who's that '' ? ?
Just me '' , Mike said .
`` Is that you , Bill '' ? ?
He located his man .
The guard stood in the shadow of the stockade wall just out of reach of the moonlight .
Mike kept walking and got within arm's reach before the man became suspicious and straightened from his lax slouch .
Mike struck with the muzzle of the pistol .
But the luck that had been running their way left him .
The guard instinctively parried the blow with his rifle .
He tried to veer the rifle around to fire into Mike's body .
Mike , off balance , managed to bat the muzzle away a moment before it exploded .
The bullet went wide .
Mike swung the pistol in a savage backlash .
This time it connected solidly on the man's temple , felling him .
The explosion of the rifle had crashed against the walls of the stockade and the deep echoes were still rolling in the hills .
The startled horses began rearing on their tethers .
Dean came rushing up .
`` Are you hit '' ? ?
He demanded .
`` No , but the fat's in the fire '' ! !
Mike said .
`` There's no chance now of all of us getting away .
You'll have to try it alone '' .
The sentry's saddled horse stood picketed nearby , having been kept handy in case of need .
Mike took the bayonet from Dean's hand and slashed the picket line .
`` Up you go '' ! !
He said .
`` Ride '' ! !
Dean resisted Mike's attempt to push him toward the horse .
`` Why not you '' ? ?
He protested .
`` Dammit '' ! !
Mike said frantically .
`` You're lighter than me .
It's our only chance now .
Try to find these Feds .
The rest of us can fort up in the house and hang on until you get back .
You're the one that's taking the big chance '' .
Dean still hesitated , but Mike lifted him almost bodily into the saddle and thrust the reins in his hand .
`` No telling how good this horse is '' , Mike panted .
`` Favor him and save something in case you hit trouble .
Watch out for Apaches when it comes daylight .
Take the pistol .
You might need it .
We'll still have the rifle , and I might be able to round up some more .
I'll stampede the rest of these horses so they can't chase you '' .
Dean leaned from the saddle and gave him a mighty whack on the back .
`` McLish '' , he said as he kicked the horse into motion , `` I'd be a mighty sad man if we never met again '' .
Then he was on his way at a gallop .
Mike ran down the line , slashing picket ropes with the bayonet .
He lifted a screeching war whoop .
That touched off a total stampede .
He darted inside the stockade and freed the horses there .
These poured through the gate and joined the flight .
The animals thundered away into the moonlight , heading for the ridges .
The guerrillas were swarming from their bivouac at the west end of the enclosure .
`` Apaches '' ! !
Mike yelled .
`` They're stealin' the stock '' ! !
He scuttled in shadow along the east wall of the stockade and then followed the south wall until he was at the rear of the two frame buildings .
He crouched there .
His shout had been taken up and repeated .
The guerrillas were running across the parade ground and through the rear gate in the wake of the departing horses .
All were carrying guns they had seized up , but they were half-clad or hardly clad at all .
Durkin and Calhoun came running from the post .
They had pistols in their hands .
They bawled questions that were not answered in the uproar .
They followed the others toward the east gate .
Beyond the stockade rifles began to explode as some of the guerrillas fired at shadows that they imagined were Apaches .
Mike made a dash to the rear of the frame buildings .
He crawled beneath the two supply wagons which stood between the buildings and peered around a corner .
The area was deserted .
A man was standing in the open door of the lighted orderly room a few yards to Mike's left , but he , too , suddenly made up his mind and went racing to join the confused activity at the east end of the stockade .
Mike crawled to the door and peered in .
The orderly room seemed to be deserted .
A lantern hung from a peg , giving light .
Ducking inside , he found that three rifles were stacked in a corner .
A brace of pistols , holstered on belts , hung from a peg , along with ammunition pouches .
An ammunition case stood open , containing canisters which contained powder cartridges .
Mike seized a blanket from a pallet in a corner , spread it on the floor and used it to form a bag in which he placed his booty .
Shouldering the load he peered from the door .
His looting of the orderly room had taken only a minute or two and the vicinity was still clear of guerrillas .
He looked at the looming hoods of the supply wagons , struck by a new inspiration .
He set his bundle down .
Snatching the lantern from its peg , he shattered its globe with a blow against a post .
He picked up the powder canister and ran out .
Bursting paper cartridges , he scattered powder beneath the nearest wagon and dumped the contents of the canister upon it .
He shouldered the blanket again , backed off , and tossed the lantern with its open wick beneath the wagon .
He turned and raced across the parade ground toward the rock house .
Powder flame gushed beneath the wagon .
The stockade was brilliantly lighted and the guerrillas sighted him .
They realized the truth .
Bullets began to snap past him .
One struck the muzzle of one of the rifles that projected from the shoulder pack .
Its force spun him around , but he recovered and got into stride again .
A bullet tore the earth from beneath his foot when he was a stride or two from safety .
Another struck him heavily in the thigh and he went down .
Guerrillas were racing toward him .
Susan and Julia came from the door and dragged him with them .
The three of them floundered through the door into the interior and fell in a heap .
Susan bounced to her feet and slammed the door .
She crouched aside as bullets beat at the portal , chewing into the planks .
Some tore entirely through the whipsawed post oak .
The iron hinges held , but the planks were in danger of being torn from the crossbars .
Mike rolled to Susan , grasped her around the knees , dragging her off her feet .
He hovered over her to shield her , for spent bullets were thudding against the rear walls .
He peered from a loophole .
Guerrillas were only a dozen yards away , charging the house .
Mike snatched a pistol from the heap of scattered booty and fired .
He dropped a man with the first bullet .
At the same moment Wheeler Fiske fired the rifle Mike had given him and another guerrilla was hit .
That halted the rush .
The guerrillas scattered for cover .
The wagons were burning fiercely .
The mudwagon had caught fire also .
The blaze was spreading to the frame buildings .
The guerrillas realized they faced a new problem .
`` Gawdamighty '' ! !
One screeched .
`` There goes our grub an' ammunition '' ! !
`` Get a bucket line going '' ! !
Calhoun shouted .
`` Hurry ! !
Hurry '' ! !
The guerrillas began a frantic search for pails in which to bring water from the spring .
But what few containers they found were inadequate .
Many of them , in increasing panic , came running with water in their hats in a ludicrous effort .
Both buildings were in flames .
The heat drove the guerrillas back .
The roof of the command post began to buckle .
`` Drag the wagons to the spring '' ! !
Lew Durkin yelled .
`` Run 'em right into the spring ! !
Hustle '' ! !
One of the wagons erupted a massive pillar of flame .
A sizable supply of powder had been touched off .
The wagons and the coach were beyond saving and so were the buildings .
The glow of the fire reached through the openings in the windows , giving light enough to examine Mike's wound .
The bullet had torn through the flesh just above the knee , inflicting an ugly gash that was forming a pool of blood on the floor .
But it had missed the bone and had passed on through .
Susan and Julia ripped strips from their clothing and bound the injury .
Mike tested the leg and found that he was able to hobble around on it .
`` So it wasn't the earthquake that made him return to his village '' ! !
`` No .
Now dammit , I don't want to go into any more explanations .
Here comes Jason .
Keep this to yourself '' .
Reverend Jason , looking worried , hurried toward us .
`` Anything wrong , cap'n ? ?
The men seem to think so '' .
`` Dirion found a large war party south of us .
They'll probably attack at dawn '' , Montero said .
He brushed past the clergyman and walked into the center of the camp .
Using his hands as a trumpet he shouted , `` Fort up ! !
Fort up ! !
There's a large war party on their way '' ! !
For a second , engages , cooks , voyageurs appeared struck dumb .
Then Little Billy began shouting orders to round up the ponies and fill the water buckets and for the cooks to hurry up with the meal .
They all flew into action .
`` That was a terrible thing to do '' , I said to Oso .
The Aricaras treated us like friends .
And here all the time you knew the Sioux would be using our rifles on them ! !
God , what a world you people live in '' .
Oso gave me an unruffled look .
`` Old Knife's got the largest war party ever seen on the river '' , he said calmly .
`` What would you have done in Montero's moccasins ? ?
Let Old Knife come up and kill you and your people , or would you steer him on someone else '' ? ?
He shook his head .
`` Mr. Manuel did that in the war .
That's why the British never got the tribes to fight for the King .
Mr. Manuel whispered in the ears of the Sioux that the Cheyennes were comin' to raid 'em for their horses .
Then he went on to the Cheyennes and told them that the Sioux was goin' to move up .
He did that with all the Nations .
Hell , they were fightin' each other so hard they had no time for anyone else .
The War Department wrote Mr. Manuel a letter and said he was a hero .
I saw that letter .
He carried it in a little wallet made of fish skin '' .
`` But that was war '' , I said .
`` There's no war on now '' .
`` You're wrong , Matt .
In this country there's a war on every time the grass turns green .
First it was the Nations against themselves , then it was them against the whites .
And it's goin' to go on like this year after year until the white people take over this land '' .
I remember being told it would happen so fast people would think it took place overnight .
`` That's why this company's important .
Once we get over the mountains others will come along .
That's why the Trust don't want us to make it .
That bastard Chambers ! !
-- Old Knife's not the only chief he'll get to do his dirty work ! !
Before we get through he'll have the Blackfeet hankerin' for our hair and our goods .
Well , talkin' ain't goin' to help -- let's fort up '' ! !
As I dug in behind one of the bales we were using as protection , I grudgingly found myself agreeing with Oso's logic , especially when I imagined what would have happened to Missy if Old Knife's large party of screeching warriors had overrun our company .
For , unlike the Sioux and the Crows , the Aricaras are not great horsemen , nor are they aggressive like the savage Blackfeet .
More of an agricultural nation , they have relied on their warriors only for defense and for survival in the endless wars of the plains .
Still , I was disgusted with myself for agreeing with Montero's methods .
Surprisingly , he had told the others what he had done .
In the brief moment I had to talk to them before I took my post on the ring of defenses , I indicated I was sickened by the methods men employed to live and trade on the river .
`` I think Montero did right '' , Amy said firmly .
`` Let the savages kill each other .
What do we care '' ? ?
Reverend Jason was understandably bitter .
`` It was a terrible thing to do .
Those little children .
''
But Oso replied calmly , `` Trouble ain't easy to dodge out in this country , rev'rend '' .
28 .
Attack
Gray Eyes attacked our camp just as the first pink threads stitched together the hills and the sky .
Our camp was in the center of a wide valley .
Montero had set up a strong position , using every bale and box we had in addition to barricades of logs and brush .
He had ordered the ponies brought inside the fortified circle and had assigned Pierre and a band of picked engages the job of trying to keep them steady under fire .
The pony herd was the one flaw in our defense ; ;
the Rees undoubtedly would try to cut down as many of the animals as possible .
Wildly bucking horses would make the position difficult to defend against charging warriors .
The cooks had prepared one of the best meals we'd had in a long time , and on Montero's orders had baked enough bread to last the day .
Buckets were filled , the herd fed and watered .
The worst part had been the waiting ; ;
although we didn't expect the attack before dawn , the long cloudy night , filled with the sounds of the industrious insects , seemed endless .
Coyotes and hunting wolves sounded like signaling Indian scouts , the whinny of a restless pony made one's skin crawl .
Oso slept unconcernedly , his rifle cradled in his arms ; ;
I didn't catch a wink .
Every time I closed my eyes , I saw Gray Eyes rushing at me with a knife .
It was a relief when they finally came .
They poured through the opening in the valley , then spread out in a long line to come at us , brandishing their lances and filling the morning with their spine-chilling scalp cry .
`` Oso '' , Montero called `` I'll get Gray Eyes '' .
`` That'll be a pleasure to see '' , the big black murmured as he stared down the barrel of his rifle .
`` Hold your fire '' , Montero was shouting .
`` Wait until my shot .
I'll shoot the first man who doesn't '' .
I could see them in my sights .
They were about a mile off ; ;
under me the ground quivered slightly .
At first they were only feathers and dark indistinguishable faces and bodies , hunched over their horses' heads .
Gradually they emerged as men .
Gray Eyes was in the lead .
His face was split by a vermilion streak , his eyes were pools of white ; ;
jagged red and black medicine symbols covered his chest .
He was naked except for a clout .
Next to him was a young boy I was sure had sat near me at one of the trading sessions .
His mouth was open , his neck corded with the strain of his screams .
I found his chest in my sights .
It had a red circle .
The circle came nearer and nearer .
My God , how long is he going to wait , I thought .
Montero's rifle cracked .
At first I thought he had missed .
Gray Eyes remained erect .
The feathered lance was still above his head .
As he started to slump over , another warrior swung him onto his horse .
I squeezed the trigger .
At the last second I dropped my sights from the bare chest and bright red circle to the chest of his pony .
I saw the pony fall like a stone and the young warrior flew over its head , bouncing like a rubber ball .
He started to run but Oso's shot caught him on the wing .
He jerked once in the grass and lay still .
`` If you're goin' to kill 'em -- ! !
Kill 'em '' ! !
Oso growled .
What else he said was lost in the rattle of gunfire on all sides .
The Aricaras broke under the devastating fire , wheeled and retreated .
`` Lead up ! !
Lead up ! !
They'll be back '' ! !
Montero was shouting .
Far up the valley I could see the Rees circling and reorganizing .
Out in front of our walls the grass was covered with dead and dying men , war shields , lances , blankets and wounded and dead horses .
The morning air was filled with the sweetish odor of new-spilled blood , the acrid stench of frightened horses , and the bitterness of burned powder .
A horse screamed as it twisted from side to side in a frenzy .
A rifle cracked ; ;
the square head fell over .
One of the warriors suddenly leaped to his feet and began running across the valley to the trees that lined the small creek .
His legs pumped furiously , his long black hair streamed out behind him .
There was a ragged volley .
He was dead before he hit the ground .
`` For Christ's sake , don't waste your powder on one of 'em '' ! !
Montero shouted furiously .
`` Wait for the charge ! !
The charge , I tell you '' ! !
The sharp cries at the end of the valley were faint .
They grew louder as the Indians charged again .
I could see their faces glistening with sweat and bear grease , their mouths open , shouting their spine-chilling cries .
`` Gray Eyes is back , , Montero said .
The war captain had been badly wounded and was fighting to hold his seat .
I could see the blood running down his chest .
He was riding between two warriors , who held him erect when he started to slump .
I forgot to aim .
In my sights I watched him looming bigger and bigger .
Montero's shot had caught him high in the chest ; ;
there was no doubt he was dying .
Again we waited for Montero .
This time he delayed so long that some of the engages shouted frantically , but they held their fire .
The horses were only several lengths away when he fired .
The bullet flung Gray Eyes from his horse .
Our rolling volley swept most of the other riders from their mounts .
But a few reached our wall .
I heard the whir of an ax and a Canadian's face burst apart in a bloody spray .
I saw Little Billy rise and fire almost point blank and an Indian's face became shattered flesh and bone .
A second leaped from his horse to the top of the bale , firing four arrows in such rapid succession it didn't seem possible they were in flight .
Men screamed .
Oso reached up , jerked the buck from the bale and snapped his neck .
Other Indians were running at the ponies , shrilling and waving blankets .
Reverend Jason got one , the Canadians the others .
I saw the clergyman kneel for a moment by the twitching body of the man he had shot , then run back to his position .
The ponies were almost uncontrollable .
The pall of dust they raised made it difficult to see when the Aricaras charged again .
This time more of them hurdled the barrier .
A small Indian dived at Montero , who caught him with a swift upward stroke of his rifle butt .
It sounded like a man kicking a melon .
Above me a dark rider was whipping his pony with a quirt in an attempt to hurdle the bales .
Although my shot killed his horse , he rolled off the bale on top of me .
I could smell woodsmoke , grease , and oil .
His eyes were dark , fluid , fearful , and he gave a sigh as my knife went in .
Coming over the wall he had seemed like a hideous devil .
Now under me I could see him for what he really was , a boy dressed up in streaks of paint .
The Aricaras made one last desperate charge .
It was pitiful to see the thin ranks of warriors , old and young , wheeling and twisting their ponies frantically from side to side only to be tumbled bleeding from their saddles by the relentless slam , slam of the cruelly efficient Hawkinses .
Others , badly wounded , gripped hands in manes , knees in bellies , held on as long as possible and then , weak from ghastly wounds , slipped sideways , slowly , almost thoughtfully , to be broken under the slashing hoofs .
Some gracefully soared from the backs of their wounded , screaming mounts to make one last defiant charge before the lead split their hearts or tore their guts .
None of them reached our walls again .
The few survivors grudgingly turned away .
In the distance we could hear the drums and the wail of the death song .
She was carrying a quirt , and she started to raise it , then let it fall again and dangle from her wrist .
`` I saw your fire '' , she said , speaking slowly , making an effort to control her anger .
`` You could burn down this whole mountainside with a fire that size .
It wouldn't matter to a fool like you .
It would to me '' .
`` All right '' , Wilson said quickly .
`` The fire's too big .
And I appreciate the advice '' .
He was losing patience again .
An hour before , with the children asleep and nothing but the strange darkness , he would have appreciated company .
She had helped him change his mind .
`` I'm not advising you '' , she said .
`` I'm telling you .
That fire's too big .
Let it burn down .
And make sure it's out when you leave in the morning '' .
He was taken aback .
It took him a long time to compose himself .
`` There's some mistake '' , he said finally .
`` You're right about the fire .
It's bigger than it has to be , though I don't see where it's doing any harm .
But you're wrong about the rest of it .
I'm not leaving in the morning .
Why should I ? ?
I own the place '' .
She showed her surprise by tightening the reins and moving the gelding around so that she could get a better look at his face .
It didn't seem to tell her anything .
She glanced around the clearing , taking in the wagon and the load of supplies and trappings scattered over the ground , the two kids , the whiteface bull that was chewing its cud just within the far reaches of the firelight .
She studied it for a long time .
Then she turned back to Wilson and smiled , and he wasn't quite sure what she meant by it .
`` You own this place '' ? ?
She said , and her tone had softened until it was almost friendly .
`` You bought it '' ? ?
`` From a man in St. Louis '' , Wilson said .
`` Jake Carwood .
Maybe you know him '' .
The girl laughed .
`` I know him .
I ought to .
My father ran him off here six years ago '' .
Wilson didn't say anything .
He stood watching the girl , wondering what was coming next .
She had picked up the quirt and was twirling it around her wrist and smiling at him .
`` Carwood didn't tell you that '' , she said .
`` No '' , Wilson said .
`` But it's understandable .
