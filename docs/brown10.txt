A few newer homes have Western flush toilets , but even with running water , they are usually Eastern style .
The next day I visited International Christian College which has developed since the war under the leadership of people who were interned and who know Japan well .
They are trying to demonstrate some different ways of teaching and learning .
The library has open shelves even in the unbound periodical stockroom .
Spiritual life is cultivated , but students do not need to be Christian .
They have an enviable record of being able to place in employment 100% of their graduates .
In the afternoon Miss Hosaka and her mother invited me to go with them and young Mrs. Kodama to see the famous Spring dances of the Geisha dancers .
Mrs. Hosaka is one of the Japanese women one reads about -- beautiful , artistically talented , an artful manager of her big household -- ( four boys and four girls ) , and yet looking like a pampered , gentle Japanese woman .
She was a real experience ! !
The dances were as beautiful as anything I have ever seen -- they rival the New York Rockettes for scenery and precision as well as imagination .
Because Don was leaving the next day , I spent the evening with him at Asia Center .
The following morning Mr. Morikawa called for me , and we went to visit schools -- kindergarten , middle-school , elementary school , and high school -- Mr. Yoshimoto's school .
There is much more freedom in the schools here than I expected -- some think too much .
There is a great deal of thought being given to the question of moral education in the schools .
With the loss of the Emperor diety in Japan , the people are left in confusion with no God or moral teachings that have strength .
The older parents continued to teach their children traditional principles , but the younger people , who have lost all faith and convictions , are now parents .
There seems to be no purpose in life that is sure -- no certain guiding principles to give stability .
As a result , money is spent quickly and freely , with no thought of its value .
Gambling is everywhere , especially among students .
Parents indulge their children .
The government has recognized the dilemma and is beginning to devise some moral education for the schools -- but the teachers often have no firm conviction and are confused .
I was told that it is quite likely that Japanese soldiers would not fight again -- for why should they ? ?
It will be painful , but interesting , to see what kind of a god these people will create or what strong convictions they will develop .
In the evening the former Oregon State science teachers met for dinner at the New Tokyo Restaurant where I had my first raw fish and found it good .
They suggested several new foods , and usually I found them good , except the sweets , which I think I could learn to like .
Six of the science teachers were present , and we had great fun .
Kyoto
After a day at Nikko , Mrs. Kodama put me on the train for Kyoto .
My instructions were that Mr. Nishimo would meet me at the hotel , but instead he and three others were at the station with a very warm welcome .
My hotel rooms on the trip were arranged by Masu and the Japan Travel Bureau and were more elegant than I would have chosen , but it was fun for once to be elegant -- I did explain to the students , however , that this was not my usual style , for their salaries are very small , and it seemed out of place for me to be housed so well .
They understood and teased me a bit about it .
I think I would have been much disappointed in Japan if I had not seen Kyoto , Nara , and Hiroshima .
Kyoto is the ancient capital of Japan and still its cultural center .
It , along with Nara , was untouched by the war -- and is now a beautiful example of the loveliness of prewar Japan .
Here I was accompanied by Mrs. Okamoto ( Fumio's mother ) , her son , Mr. Washizu ( a prospective student with whom I have been corresponding for more than a year ) , and Mr. Nishima , one of the science teachers .
I arrived at 7:00 a.m. and by 9:00 a.m. I had finished breakfast and was on my way to see what they had planned .
We walked miles and saw various shrines and gardens .
We visited the Okamoto home -- where for the first time I saw the famous tea ceremony .
At 6:00 p.m. we went to the Kyoto Spring dances at the place where these beautiful dances originated .
They were even better than those of Tokyo -- more spectacular and more imaginative .
After a supper of unagi ( rice with eel -- eel which is raised in an ice-cold pond at the foot of Mt. Fuji ) , I returned to my beautiful room to sleep as hard as possible to be ready for another busy day .
We started at 9 a.m. to visit the Kyoto University where Mr. Washizu is attending .
I was amazed at the very poor hospital facilities accompanying the medical school .
They apologized for the condition , including dirt and flies , and I was a little at a loss to know what to say .
There seemed to be no excuse ? ?
I don't have the answer yet .
We had tea at Mr. Washizu's home where I learned that he , too , comes from a very wealthy family .
His grandfather is a Buddhist priest ; ;
and he , being the eldest , was supposed to be a priest , but he chose to do differently , and one of his brothers is to become the priest .
This is a significant fact in Japan , for only a few years ago he would have had no choice .
In his big home live four families and thirty people , so it needs to be big .
Also , there are housed here some priceless historical treasures from 400 to 600 years old -- paintings , lacquer , brocade , etc. .
He had displayed more of them than usual so that I could enjoy them .
About 100 of the most important items he had already given to the museum .
The house itself is 400 years old with all the craftsmanship of older , less-hurried times .
Nara , Osaka , and Hiroshima
Mr. Nishima went with me on the train to Nara .
We passed his house and school on the way .
In Nara I stayed at the hotel where the Prince and Princess had stayed on their honeymoon .
A new red carpet had been laid for their coming , but I walked on it , too .
Here Mr. Yoneda met us after a three-hour train trip from the town where he teaches .
Even though we had walked miles in Kyoto that day , we started out again to see Nara at night .
In the evening both of the men went with me on the train 30 miles to Osaka to put me on the train for Hiroshima .
Again the plan was for me to go alone , but they wouldn't let me .
At Osaka , Mr. Yoneda had to leave us to get the train to his home , but Mr. Nishima and I had an hour and a half before train time to see Osaka at night .
It is the second largest city in Japan , with about four million people .
One spot in Osaka I shall always remember -- the bridge where we stood to watch the reflections of the elaborate neon signs in the still waters of the river .
In the midst of a great busy city , people take time to enjoy the beauty of natural reflection of artificial light .
My train arrived in Hiroshima at the awful hour of 4:45 a.m. .
I had planned to go to the hotel by taxi and sleep a little , after which Mr. Uno would arrive and pilot me around .
But there he was at the train with an Oregon State pennant in his hand .
I know now why the students insisted that I go to Hiroshima even when I told them I didn't want to .
They knew that I was still grieving over the tragic event , and they felt that if I could see the recovery and the spirit of the people , who hold no grudge , but who also regret Pearl Harbor , I would be happier and would understand better a new Japan .
There were no words to say this but there was no need .
The teachers of Mr. Uno's school gave me a small gift to thank me for coming .
Hiroshima is a better city than it was before -- in the minds of the people I met was a strong determination for peace and understanding .
I was grateful for their insight into my need for this experience .
A better world may yet come out of Hiroshima .
Tokyo
On arriving in Tokyo later we were met by Masu who took us immediately to her university , the Japanese Women's University .
This day was `` Open House for Parents '' day , and the girls were busy preparing exhibits and arranging tea tables .
Everything was in an exciting turmoil -- full of anticipation and fun .
It was thrilling to see the effect of an American-trained teacher on Japanese students in a class in Home Planning .
Our Masu is one of the very few architects in Japan who is trying to plan homes around family functions and women's needs .
I am told the time will soon come when women will find it necessary to do most of their own work , and even now it is important to have conveniences for the use of servants .
Many of the features of the homes are the latest modern devices in American homes , but an interesting blend of cultures finds us using Japanese artfulness in our own Western architecture at the same time that the Japanese are adopting Western utility patterns .
At this Women's University we find a monument to a courageous family who believed that Japanese women also should be educated .
Even today there are some doubts about the value of education for Japanese women , but this University continues to grow and to send its students out into the community .
Active alumnae have built a fine building on the campus where members can come and stay for a few days or longer and where they can have their social gatherings and professional meetings .
As far as I am concerned there is continuous piling up of evidence that the creative fresh ideas which are needed in the world are going to be found by educated women unafraid to break traditions .
Masu is also teaching in a municipally-sponsored school for Japanese widows in Tokyo .
Here the women learn to keep house as maids ; ;
they become skilled in cooking and cleaning and in receiving guests .
They learn how to take care of children and sick members of the family .
They have model kitchens , a sick room with a model patient in bed , and a nursery with a life-like doll .
Although the training is only for one month , it is intensive and thorough .
Graduates of this maid's school are much in demand and can always find work immediately .
Occasionally they return for additional training .
Masu's home economics training comes into play as she designs cupboards along modern functional lines for the storage of cleaning materials .
Masu also uses the training she got in an American home where she learned to polish furniture , clean corners , and work effectively in keeping a shiny house .
Her education in the United States , not just in a classroom , but also in an American house with an American housekeeper , stands her in good stead .
University of Tokyo
After a fine luncheon in the cafeteria , the kitchen of which Masu had planned , Mr. Washizu and I left to meet representatives of the USIS for a visit to the University of Tokyo .
Here again it was vacation time and there were many things I could not see , but I was able to visit with a professor who is famous in Japanese circles and be guided through the grounds by his assistant .
The achievement of the desegregation of certain lunch counters not only by wise action by local community leaders but by voluntary action following consultation between Attorney General Rogers and the heads of certain national chain stores should , of course , be applauded .
But for it to be just to attain this same result by means of the force of a boycott throughout the nation would require the verification of facts contrary to those assumed in the foregoing case .
The suppositions in the previous illustration might be sufficiently altered by establishing a connection between general company practice and local practice in the South , and by establishing such direct connection between the practice and the economic well-being of stores located in New York and general company policy .
Then the boycott would not be secondary , but a primary one .
It would be directed against the actual location of the unjust policy which , for love's sake and for the sake of justice , must be removed , and , indivisible from this , to the economic injury of the people directly and objectively a part of this policy .
Perhaps this would be sufficient to justify an economic boycott of an entire national chain in order , by threatening potential injury to its entire economy , to effect an alteration of the policy of its local stores in the matter of segregation .
Such a general boycott might still be a blunt or indiscriminating instrument , and therefore of questionable justification .
Action located where the evil is concentrated will prove most decisive and is most clearly legitimate .
Moreover , prudence alone would indicate that , unless the local customs are already ready to fall when pushed , the results of direct economic action everywhere upon national chain stores will likely be simply to give undue advantage to local and state stores which conform to these customs , leading to greater decentralization and local autonomy within the company , or even ( as the final self-defeat of an unjust application of economic pressure to correct injustice ) to its going out of business in certain sections of the country ( as , for that matter , the Quakers , who once had many meetings in the pre-Civil War South , largely went out of business in that part of the country over the slavery issue , never to recover a large number of southern adherents ) .
In any case , anyone who fails to make significant distinction between primary and secondary applications of economic pressure would in principle already have justified that use of economic boycott as a means which broke out a few years ago or was skillfully organized by White Citizens' Councils in the entire state of Mississippi against every local Philco dealer in that state , in protest against a Philco-sponsored program over a national TV network on which was presented a drama showing , it seemed , a `` high yellow gal '' smooching with a white man .
It is true , of course , that the end or objective of this action was different .
But since this is a world in which people disagree about ends and goals and concerning justice and injustice , and since , in a situation where direct action and economic pressure are called for , the justice of the matter has either not been clearly defined by law or the law is not effectively present , there has to be a morality of means applied in every case in which people take it upon themselves to use economic pressures or other forms of force .
The need that we not give unqualified approval to any but a limited use of economic pressure directed against the actual doers of injustice is clear also in light of the fact that White Citizens' Councils seem resolved to maintain segregation mainly by the use of these same means and not ordinarily by physical violence .
An unlimited use of economic pressures for diametrically opposite causes could devastate the pre-conditions of any fellow humanity as surely as this would be destroyed by the use of more obviously brutal means .
The end or aim of the action , of course , is also important , especially where it is not alone a matter of changing community customs but of the use of deadly economic power to intimidate a person from stepping forward to claim his legal rights , e.g. , against Negroes who register to vote in Fayette County , Tennessee , at the present moment .
Here the recourse is in steps to give economic sustenance to those being despoiled , and to legal remedies .
This , however , is sufficient to show that more or less non-violent resistance and economic conflict ( if both sides are strong enough ) can be war of all against all no less than if other means are used .
It is also sufficient to show the Christian and any other champion of justice that he needs to make sure not only that his cause is just but also that his conduct is just , i.e. , that , if economic pressure has to be resorted to , this be applied directly against those persons directly in the way of some salutary change in business or institutional practices , while , if injury fall upon others , it fall upon them indirectly and secondarily ( however inevitably ) and not by deliberate intent and direct action against them .
It is clear that non-violent resistance is a mode of action in need of justification and limitation in Christian morality , like any other form of resistance .
The language used itself often makes very clear that this is only another form of struggle for victory ( perhaps to be chosen above all others ) .
One of the sit-in leaders has said : `` Nobody from the top of Heaven to the bottom of Hell can stop the march to freedom .
Everybody in the world today might as well make up their minds to march with freedom or freedom is going to march over them '' .
The present writer certainly agrees with that statement , and would also affirm this -- in the order of justice .
However , it is also a Christian insight to know that unless charity interpenetrates justice it is not likely to be freedom that marches forward .
And when charity interpenetrates man's struggle for justice and freedom it does not simply surround this with a sentimental good will .
It also definitely fashions conduct in the way explained above , and this means far more than in the choice of non-violent means .
R. B. Gregg has written that `` non-violence and good will of the victim act like the lack of physical opposition by the user of physical jiu-jitsu , to cause the attacker to lose his moral balance .
He suddenly and unexpectedly loses the moral support which the usual violent resistance of most victims would render him '' ; ;
and again , that `` the object of non-violent resistance is partly analogous to this object of war -- namely , to demoralize the opponent , to break his will , to destroy his confidence , enthusiasm , and hope .
In another respect it is dissimilar , for non-violent resistance demoralizes the opponent only to re-establish in him a new morale that is firmer because it is based on sounder values '' .
A trial of strength , however , is made quite inevitable by virtue of the fact that anyone engaging in non-violent resistance will be convinced that his action is based on sounder values than those of his opponent ; ;
and in warfare with any means , men commonly disagree over the justice of the cause .
This makes necessary a morality of means , and principles governing the conduct of resistance whenever this is thought to be justified .
The question , then , is whether sufficient discrimination in the use of even non-violent means of coercion is to be found in the fact that such conduct demoralizes and overcomes the opponent while re-moralizing and re-establishing him .
Here it is relevant to remember that men commonly regard some causes as more important than their lives ; ;
and to them it will seem insignificant that it is proposed to defeat such causes non-violently .
A technique by which it is proposed to enter with compulsion into the very heart of a man and determine his values may often in fact seem the more unlimited aggression .
Among Christian groups , the Mennonites have commonly been aware more than others of the fact that the nature of divine charity raises decisively the question of the Christian use of all forms of pressure .
Since the will and word of God are for them concentrated in Christ-like love , it seems clear to them that non-violent resistance is quite another thing .
`` The primary objective of non-violence '' , writes the outstanding Mennonite ethicist , `` is not peace , or obedience to the divine will , but rather certain desired social changes , for personal , or class , or national advantage '' .
Without agreeing with every phrase in this statement , we must certainly assert the great difference between Christian love and any form of resistance , and then go on beyond the Mennonite position and affirm that Christian love-in-action must first justify and then determine the moral principles limiting resistance .
These principles we have now set forth .
Economy in the use of power needs not only to be asserted , but clearly specified ; ;
and when this is done it will be found that the principles governing Christian resistance cut across the distinction between violent and non-violent means , and apply to both alike , justifying either on occasion and always limiting either action .
Economy in the use of power means more than inflicting a barely intolerable pressure upon an opponent and upon the injustice opposed .
That would amount to calculating the means and justifying them wholly in terms of their effectiveness in reaching desired goals .
There must also be additional and more fundamental discrimination in the use of means of resistance , violent or non-violent .
The justification in Christian conscience of the use of any mode of resistance also lays down its limitation -- in the distinction between the persons against whom pressure is primarily directed , those upon whom it may be permitted also to fall , and those who may never be directly repressed for the sake even of achieving some great good .
In these terms , the `` economic withdrawal '' of the Negroes of Nashville , Tennessee , from trading in the center city , for example , was clearly justified , since these distinctions do not require that only people subjectively guilty be singled out .
We may now take up for consideration a hard case which seems to require either no action employing economic pressure or else action that would seem to violate the principles set forth above .
There may be instances in which , if economic pressure is to be undertaken at all , this would have to be applied without discrimination against a whole people .
An excellent article was published recently in the Journal Of The Church Peace Union by a South African journalist on the inhuman economic conditions of the blacks in South Africa , amounting to virtual slavery , and the economic complicity of both the government and the people of the United States in these conditions .
`` Billions of American dollars , not only from capital investors but also from the pockets of U.S. taxpayers '' , this author states , `` are being poured into South Africa to support a system dedicated to the oppression , the persecution , and the almost diabolical exploitation of 12 million people the color of whose skins happens not to be white '' .
Both the conditions and the complicity are documented in considerable detail .
This leads to the conclusion that `` the fact is inescapable that America does have a say in whether or not apartheid shall continue '' .
Our leadership in a wide economic boycott of South Africa would be not only in accord , it seems , with the moral conscience of America , not to be denied because we also as a people have widespread injustice in the relations of the races in our own country , but also in accord with our law , U.S. Code Title 19 , Section 1307 , which forbids the importation of goods made by forced or convict labor .
Not only should this provision be enforced but other economic and political actions might be taken which , this author believes , `` must surely be supported by every American who values the freedom that has been won for him and whose conscience is not so dominated by the lines in his account books that he can willingly and knowingly contribute to the enslavement of another nation '' .
Northern liberals are the chief supporters of civil rights and of integration .
They have also led the nation in the direction of a welfare state .
And both in their objectives of non-discrimination and of social progress they have had ranged against them the Southerners who are called Bourbons .
The name presumably derives from the French royal house which never learned and never forgot ; ;
since Bourbon whiskey , though of Kentucky origin , is at least as much favored by liberals in the North as by conservatives in the South .
The nature of the opposition between liberals and Bourbons is too little understood in the North .
The race problem has tended to obscure other , less emotional , issues which may fundamentally be even more divisive .
It is these other differences between North and South -- other , that is , than those which concern discrimination or social welfare -- which I chiefly discuss herein .
I write about Northern liberals from considerable personal experience .
A Southerner married to a New Englander , I have lived for many years in a Connecticut commuting town with a high percentage of artists , writers , publicity men , and business executives of egghead tastes .
Most of them are Democrats and nearly all consider themselves , and are viewed as , liberals .
This is puzzling to an outsider conscious of the classic tradition of liberalism , because it is clear that these Democrats who are left-of-center are at opposite poles from the liberal Jefferson , who held that the best government was the least government .
Yet paradoxically my liberal friends continue to view Jefferson as one of their patron saints .
When I question them as to what they mean by concepts like liberty and democracy , I find that they fall into two categories : the simpler ones who have simply accepted the shibboleths of their faith without analysis ; ;
and the intelligent , cynical ones who scornfully reply that these things don't count any more in the world of to-day .
I am naive , they say , to make use of such words .
I take this to mean that the intelligent -- and therefore necessarily cynical ? ?
-- liberal considers that the need for a national economy with controls that will assure his conception of social justice is so great that individual and local liberties as well as democratic processes may have to yield before it .
This seems like an attitude favoring a sort of totalitarian bureaucracy which , under a President of the same stamp , would try to coerce an uncooperative Congress or Supreme Court .
As for states' rights , they have never counted in the thinking of my liberal friends except as irritations of a minor and immoral nature which exist now only as anachronisms .
The American liberal may , in the world of to-day , have a strong case ; ;
but he presents it publicly so enmeshed in hypocrisy that it is not an honest one .
Why , in the first place , call himself a liberal if he is against laissez-faire and favors an authoritarian central government with womb-to-tomb controls over everybody ? ?
If he attaches little importance to personal liberty , why not make this known to the world ? ?
And if he is so scornful of the rights of states , why not advocate a different sort of constitution that he could more sincerely support ? ?
I am concerned here , however , with the Northern liberal's attitude toward the South .
It appears to be one of intense dislike , which he makes little effort to conceal even in the presence of Southern friends .
His assumption seems to be that any such friends , being tolerable humans , must be more liberal than most Southerners and therefore at least partly in sympathy with his views .
Time's editor , Thomas Griffith , in his book , The Waist-High Culture , wrote : `` most of what was different about it ( the Deep South ) I found myself unsympathetic to .
'' This , for the liberals I know , would be an understatement .
Theirs is no mere lack of sympathy , but something closer to the passionate hatred that was directed against Fascism .
I do not think that my experience would be typical for Southerners living in the North .
In business circles , usually conservative , this sort of atmosphere would hardly be found .
But in our case -- and neither my wife nor I have extreme views on integration , nor are we given to emotional outbursts -- the situation has ruined one or two valued friendships and come close to wrecking several more .
In fact it has caused us to give serious thought to moving our residence south , because it is not easy for the most objective Southerner to sit calmly by when his host is telling a roomful of people that the only way to deal with Southerners who oppose integration is to send in troops and shoot the bastards down .
Accounts have been published of Northern liberals in the South up against segregationist prejudice , especially in state-supported universities where pressure may be strong to uphold the majority view .
But these accounts do not show that Northerners have been subjected to embarrassment or provocation by Yankee-hatred displayed in social gatherings .
From my wife's experience and other sources , this seems to be rarely encountered in educated circles .
The strong feeling is certainly there ; ;
but there is a leavening of liberalism among college graduates throughout the South , especially among those who studied in the North .
And social relations arising out of business ties impose courtesy , if not sympathy , toward resident and visiting Northerners .
Also , among the latter a large percentage soon acquire the prevalent Southern attitude on most social problems .
There are of course many Souths ; ;
but for this discussion the most important division is between those who have been reconstructed and those who haven't .
My definition of this much abused adjective is that a reconstructed rebel is one who is glad that the North won the War .
Nobody knows how many Southerners there are in this category .
I suspect that there are far more unreconstructed ones than the North likes to believe .
I never heard of a poll being taken on the question .
No doubt such a thing would be considered unpatriotic .
Prior to 1954 I imagine that a majority of Southerners would have voted against the Confederacy .
Since the Supreme Court's decision of that year this is more doubtful ; ;
and if a poll had been taken immediately following the dispatch of troops to Little Rock I believe the majority would have been for the Old South .
Belief in the traditional way of life persists much more in the older states than in the new ones .
Probably a larger percentage of Virginians and South Carolinians remain unreconstructed than elsewhere , with Georgia , North Carolina , and Alabama following along after them .
Old attitudes are held more tenaciously in the Tidewater than the Piedmont ; ;
so that a line running down the length of the South marking the upper limits of tidewater would roughly divide the Old South from the new , but with , of course , important minority enclaves .
The long-settled areas of states like Virginia and South Carolina developed the ante-bellum culture to its richest flowering , and there the memory is more precious , and the consciousness of loss the greater .
Also , we should not even to-day discount the fact that a region such as the coastal lowlands centering on Charleston had closer ties with England and the West Indies than with the North even after independence .
The social and psychological consequences of this continue to affect the area .
In certain respects defeat increased the persistent Anglophilia of the Old South .
Poor where they had once been rich , humbled where they had been arrogant , having no longer any hope of sharing in the leadership of the nation , the rebels who would not surrender in spirit drew comfort from the sympathy they felt extended to them by the mother country .
And no doubt many people in states like the Carolinas and Georgia , which were among the most Tory in sentiment in the eighteenth century , bitterly regretted the revolt against the Crown .
Among Bourbons the racial issue may have less to do with their remaining unreconstructed than other factors .
All Southerners agree that slavery had to go ; ;
but many historians maintain that except for Northern meddling it would have ended in states like Virginia years before it did .
Southern resentment has been over the method of its ending , the invasion , and Reconstruction ; ;
their fears now are of miscegenation and Negro political control in many counties .
But apart from racial problems , the old unreconstructed South -- to use the moderate words favored by Mr. Thomas Griffith -- finds itself unsympathetic to most of what is different about the civilization of the North .
And this , in effect , means most of modern America .
It is hard to see how the situation could be otherwise .
And therein , I feel , many Northerners delude themselves about the South .
For one thing , this is not a subject often discussed or analyzed .
There seems to be almost a conspiracy of silence veiling it .
I suppose the reason is a kind of wishful thinking : don't talk about the final stages of Reconstruction and they will take care of themselves .
Or else the North really believes that all Southerners except a few quaint old characters have come around to realizing the errors of their past , and are now at heart sharers of the American Dream , like everybody else .
If the circumstances are faced frankly it is not reasonable to expect this to be true .
The situation of the South since 1865 has been unique in the western world .
Regardless of rights and wrongs , a population and an area appropriate to a pre-World-War- 1 great power have been , following conquest , ruled against their will by a neighboring people , and have had imposed upon them social and economic controls they dislike .
And the great majority of these people are of Anglo-Saxon or Celtic descent .
This is the only case in modern history of a people of Britannic origin submitting without continued struggle to what they view as foreign domination .
The fact is due mainly to international wars , both hot and cold .
In every war of the United States since the Civil War the South was more belligerent than the rest of the country .
So instead of being tests of the South's loyalty , the Spanish War , the two World Wars , and the Korean War all served to overcome old grievances and cement reunion .
And there is no section of the nation more ardent than the South in the cold war against Communism .
Had the situation been reversed , had , for instance , England been the enemy in 1898 because of issues of concern chiefly to New England , there is little doubt that large numbers of Southerners would have happily put on their old Confederate uniforms to fight as allies of Britain .
It is extraordinary that a people as proud and warlike as Southerners should have been as docile as they have .
The North should thank its stars that such has been the case ; ;
but at the same time it should not draw false inferences therefrom .
The two main charges levelled against the Bourbons by liberals is that they are racists and social reactionaries .
There is much truth in both these charges , and not many Bourbons deny them .
Whatever their faults , they are not hypocrites .
Most of them sincerely believe that the Anglo-Saxon is the best race in the world and that it should remain pure .
Many Northeners believe this , too , but few of them will say so publicly .
The Bourbon economic philosophy , moreover , is not very different from that of Northern conservatives .
But those among the Bourbons who remain unreconstructed go much further than this .
They believe that if the South had been let alone it would have produced a civilization superior to that of modern America .
As it is , they consider that the North is now reaping the fruits of excess egalitarianism , that in spite of its high standard of living the `` American way '' has been proved inferior to the English and Scandinavian ways , although they disapprove of the socialistic features of the latter .
The South's antipathy to Northern civilization includes such charges as poor manners , harsh accents , lack of appreciation of the arts of living like gastronomy and the use of leisure .
Their own easier , slower tempo is especially dear to Southerners ; ;
and I have heard many say that they are content to earn a half or a third as much as they could up North because they so much prefer the quieter habits of their home town .
In the past , the duties of the state , as Sir Henry Maine noted long ago , were only two in number : internal order and external security .
By prevailing over other claimants for the loyalties of men , the nation-state maintained an adequate measure of certainty and order within its territorial borders .
Outside those limits it asserted , as against other states , a position of sovereign equality , and , as against the `` inferior '' peoples of the non-Western world , a position of dominance .
It became the sole `` subject '' of `` international law '' ( a term which , it is pertinent to remember , was coined by Bentham ) , a body of legal principle which by and large was made up of what Western nations could do in the world arena .
( That corpus of law was a reflection of the power system in existence during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries .
Speaking generally , it furthered -- and still tends to further -- the interests of the Western powers .
The enormous changes in world politics have , however , thrown it into confusion , so much so that it is safe to say that all international law is now in need of reexamination and clarification in light of the social conditions of the present era .
)
Beyond the two basic tasks mentioned above , no attention was paid by statesman or scholar to an idea of state responsibility , either internally or externally .
This was particularly true in the world arena , which was an anarchical battleground characterized by strife and avaricious competition for colonial empires .
That any sort of duty was owed by his nation to other nations would have astonished a nineteenth-century statesman .
His duty was to his sovereign and to his nation , and an extension to peoples beyond the territorial boundaries was not to be contemplated .
Thus , to cite but one example , the Pax Britannica of the nineteenth century , whether with the British navy ruling the seas or with the City of London ruling world finance , was strictly national in motivation , however much other nations ( e.g. , the United States ) may have incidentally benefited .
At the same time , all suggestions that some sort of societal responsibility existed for the welfare of the people within the territorial state was strongly resisted .
Social Darwinism was able to stave off the incipient socialist movement until well into the present century .
However , in recent decades , for what doubtless are multiple reasons , an unannounced but nonetheless readily observable shift has occurred in both facets of national activity .
A concept of responsibility is in process of articulation and establishment .
Already firmly implanted internally , it is a growing factor in external matters .
A little more than twenty years ago the American people turned an important corner .
In what has aptly been called a `` constitutional revolution '' , the basic nature of government was transformed from one essentially negative in nature ( the `` night-watchman state '' ) to one with affirmative duties to perform .
The `` positive state '' came into existence .
For lawyers , reflecting perhaps their parochial preferences , there has been a special fascination since then in the role played by the Supreme Court in that transformation -- the manner in which its decisions altered in `` the switch in time that saved nine '' , President Roosevelt's ill-starred but in effect victorious `` Court-packing plan '' , the imprimatur of judicial approval that was finally placed upon social legislation .
Of greater importance , however , is the content of those programs , which have had and are having enormous consequences for the American people .
Labor relations have been transformed , income security has become a standardized feature of political platforms , and all the many facets of the American version of the welfare state have become part of the conventional wisdom .
A national consensus of near unanimity exists that these governmental efforts are desirable as well as necessary .
Ratified in the Republican Party victory in 1952 , the Positive State is now evidenced by political campaigns being waged not on whether but on how much social legislation there should be .
The general acceptance of the idea of governmental ( i.e. , societal ) responsibility for the economic well-being of the American people is surely one of the two most significant watersheds in American constitutional history .
The other , of course , was the Civil War , the conflict which a century ago insured national unity over fragmentation .
A third , one of at least equal and perhaps even greater importance , is now being traversed : American immersion and involvement in world affairs .
Internal national responsibility , now a truism , need not be documented .
Nevertheless , it may be helpful to cite one example -- that of employment -- for , as will be shown below , it cuts across both facets of the new concept .
Thirty years ago , while the nation was wallowing in economic depression , the prevailing philosophy of government was to stand aside and allow `` natural forces '' to operate and cure the distress .
That guiding principle of the Hoover Administration fell to the siege guns of the New Deal ; ;
less than a score of years later Congress enacted the Employment Act of 1946 , by which the national government assumed the responsibility of taking action to insure conditions of maximum employment .
Hands-off the economy was replaced by conscious guidance through planning -- the economic side of the constitutional revolution .
In 1961 the first important legislative victory of the Kennedy Administration came when the principle of national responsibility for local economic distress won out over a `` state's-responsibility '' proposal -- provision was made for payment for unemployment relief by nation-wide taxation rather than by a levy only on those states afflicted with manpower surplus .
The American people have indeed come a long way in the brief interval between 1930 and 1961 .
Internal national responsibility is a societal response to the impact of the Industrial Revolution .
Reduced to its simplest terms , it is an assumption of a collective duty to compensate for the inability of individuals to cope with the rigors of the era .
National responsibility for individual welfare is a concept not limited to the United States or even to the Western nations .
A measure of its widespread acceptance may be derived from a statement of the International Congress of Jurists in 1959 .
Meeting in New Delhi under the auspices of the International Commission of Jurists , a body of lawyers from the free world , the Congress redefined and expanded the traditional Rule of Law to include affirmative governmental duties .
It is noteworthy that the majority of the delegates to the Congress were from the less developed , former colonial nations .
The Rule of Law , historically a principle according everyone his `` day in court '' before an impartial tribunal , was broadened substantively by making it a responsibility of government to promote individual welfare .
Recognizing that the Rule of Law is `` a dynamic concept which should be employed not only to safeguard the civil and political rights of the individual in a free society '' , the Congress asserted that it also included the responsibility `` to establish social , economic , educational and cultural conditions under which his legitimate aspirations and dignity may be realized '' .
The idea of national responsibility thus has become a common feature of the nations of the non-Soviet world .
For better or for worse , we all now live in welfare states , the organizing principle of which is collective responsibility for individual well-being .
Whether a concept analogous to the principle of internal responsibility operates in a nation's external relations is less obvious and more difficult to establish .
The hypothesis ventured here is that it does , and that evidence is accumulating validating that proposition .
The content is not the same , however : rather than individual security , it is the security and continuing existence of an `` ideological group '' -- those in the `` free world '' -- that is basic .
External national responsibility involves a burgeoning requirement that the leaders of the Western nations so guide their decisions as to further the viability of other friendly nations .
If internal responsibility suggests acceptance of the socialist ideal of equality , then external responsibility implies adherence to principles of ideological supranationalism .
Reference to two other concepts -- nationalism and sovereignty -- may help to reveal the contours of the new principle .
In its beginnings the nation-state had to struggle to assert itself -- internally , against feudal groups , and externally , against the power and influence of such other claimants for loyalty as the Church .
The breakup of the Holy Roman Empire and the downfall of feudalism led , not more than two centuries ago , to the surge of nationalism .
( Since the time-span of the nation-state coincides roughly with the separate existence of the United States as an independent entity , it is perhaps natural for Americans to think of the nation as representative of the highest form of order , something permanent and unchanging .
) The concept of nationalism is the political principle that epitomizes and glorifies the territorial state as the characteristic type of socal structure .
But it is more than that .
For it includes the emotional ties that bind men to their homeland and the complex motivations that hold a large group of people together as a unit .
Today , as new nations rise from the former colonial empires , nationalism is one of the hurricane forces loose in the world .
Almost febrile in intensity , the principle has become worldwide in application -- unfortunately at the very time that nationalist fervors can wreak greatest harm .
Historically , however , the concept is one that has been of marked benefit to the people of the Western civilizational group .
By subduing disparate lesser groups the nation has , to some degree at least , broadened the capacity for individual liberty .
Within their confines , moreover , technological and industrial growth has proceeded at an accelerated pace , thus increasing the cornucopia from which material wants can be satisfied .
While the pattern is uneven , some having gained more than others , nationalism has in fact served the Western peoples well .
( Whether historical nationalism helped the peoples of the remainder of the world , and whether today's nationalism in the former colonial areas has equally beneficial aspects , are other questions .
)
It is one of the ironic quirks of history that the viability and usefulness of nationalism and the territorial state are rapidly dissipating at precisely the time that the nation-state attained its highest number ( approximately 100 ) .
But it is more than irony : one of the main reasons why nationalism is no longer a tenable concept is because it has spread throughout the planet .
In other words , nationalism worked well enough when it had limited application , both as to geography and as to population ; ;
it becomes a perilous anachronism when adopted on a world-wide basis .
Complementing the political principle of nationalism is the legal principle of sovereignty .
The former receives its legitimacy from the latter .
Operating side by side , together they helped shore up the nation-state .
While sovereignty has roots in antiquity , in its present usage it is essentially modern .
Jean Bodin , writing in the sixteenth century , may have been the seminal thinker , but it was the vastly influential John Austin who set out the main lines of the concept as now understood .
Austin's nineteenth-century view of law and sovereignty still dominates much of today's legal and political thinking .
To him , law is the command of the sovereign ( the English monarch ) who personifies the power of the nation , while sovereignty is the power to make law -- i.e. , to prevail over internal groups and to be free from the commands of other sovereigns in other nations .
These fundamental ideas -- the indivisibility of sovereignty and its dual ( internal-external ) aspects -- still remain the core of that concept of ultimate political power .
The nation-state , then , exemplifies the principle of nationalism and exercises sovereignty : supreme power over domestic affairs and independence from outside control .
In fact , however , both principles have always been nebulous and loosely defined .
High-level abstractions are always difficult to pin down with precision .
That is particularly true of sovereignty when it is applied to democratic societies , in which `` popular '' sovereignty is said to exist , and in federal nations , in which the jobs of government are split .
Nevertheless , nationalism and sovereignty are reputed , in the accepted wisdom , to describe the modern world .
Is there a different reality behind the facade ? ?
Does the surface hide a quite different picture ? ?
The short answer to those questions is `` yes '' .
Both concepts are undergoing alteration ; ;
to some degree they are being supplanted by a concept of national responsibility .
As evidence to support that view , consider the following illustrative instances .
Can thermonuclear war be set off by accident ? ?
What steps have been taken to guard against the one sort of mishap that could trigger the destruction of continents ? ?
Are we as safe as we should be from such a disaster ? ?
Is anything being done to increase our margin of safety ? ?
Will the danger increase or decrease ? ?
I have just asked these questions in the Pentagon , in the White House , in offices of key scientists across the country and aboard the submarines that prowl for months underwater , with neat rows of green launch tubes which contain Polaris missiles and which are affectionately known as `` Sherwood Forest '' .
I asked the same questions inside the launch-control rooms of an Atlas missile base in Wyoming , where officers who wear sidearms are manning the `` commit buttons '' that could start a war -- accidentally or by design -- and in the command centers where other pistol-packing men could give orders to push such buttons .
To the men in the instrument-jammed bomber cockpits , submarine compartments and the antiseptic , windowless rooms that would be the foxholes of tomorrow's impersonal intercontinental wars , the questions seem farfetched .
There is unceasing pressure , but its sources are immediate .
`` Readiness exercises '' are almost continuous .
Each could be the real thing .
In the command centers there are special clocks ready to tick off the minutes elapsed since `` E hour '' .
`` E '' stands for `` execution '' -- the moment a `` go order '' would unleash an American nuclear strike .
There is little time for the men in the command centers to reflect about the implications of these clocks .
They are preoccupied riding herd on control panels , switches , flashing colored lights on pale green or gray consoles that look like business machines .
They know little about their machinery beyond mechanical details .
Accidental war is so sensitive a subject that most of the people who could become directly involved in one are told just enough so they can perform their portions of incredibly complex tasks .
Among the policy makers , generals , physicists , psychologists and others charged with controlling the actions of the button pushers and their `` hardware '' , the answers to my questions varied partly according to a man's flair for what the professionals in this field call `` scenarios '' .
As an Air Force psychiatrist put it : `` You can't have dry runs on this one '' .
The experts are thus forced to hypothesize sequences of events that have never occurred , probably never will -- but possibly might .
Only one rule prevailed in my conversations with these men : The more highly placed they are -- that is , the more they know -- the more concerned they have become .
Already accidental war is a silent guest at the discussions within the Kennedy Administration about the urgency of disarmament and nearly all other questions of national security .
Only recently new `` holes '' were discovered in our safety measures , and a search is now on for more .
Work is under way to see whether new restraining devices should be installed on all nuclear weapons .
Meanwhile , the experts speak of wars triggered by `` false pre-emption '' , `` escalation '' , `` unauthorized behavior '' and other terms that will be discussed in this report .
They inhabit a secret world centered on `` go codes '' and `` gold phones '' .
Their conversations were , almost invariably , accompanied by the same gestures -- arms and pointed forefingers darting toward each other in arclike semicircular motions .
One arm represented our bombers and missiles , the other arm `` theirs '' .
Yet implicit in each movement was the death of millions , perhaps hundreds of millions , perhaps you and me -- and the experts .
These men are not callous .
It is their job to think about the unthinkable .
Unanimously they believe that the world would become a safer place if more of us -- and more Russians and Communist Chinese , too -- thought about accidental war .
The first systematic thinking about this Pandora's box within Pandora's boxes was done four years ago by Fred Ikle , a frail , meek-mannered Swiss-born sociologist .
He was , and is , with the RAND Corporation , a nonprofit pool of thinkers financed by the U.S. Air Force .
His investigations made him the Paul Revere of accidental war , and safety procedures were enormously increased .
In recent weeks , as a result of a sweeping defense policy reappraisal by the Kennedy Administration , basic United States strategy has been modified -- and large new sums allocated -- to meet the accidental-war danger and to reduce it as quickly as possible .
The chain starts at BMEWS ( Ballistic Missile Early Warning System ) in Thule , Greenland .
Its radar screens would register Soviet missiles shortly after they are launched against the United States .
BMEWS intelligence is simultaneously flashed to NORAD ( North American Air Defense Command ) in Colorado Springs , Colorado , for interpretation ; ;
to the SAC command and control post , forty-five feet below the ground at Offutt Air Force Base , near Omaha , Nebraska ; ;
to the Joint War Room of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in the Pentagon and to the President .
Telephones , Teletypes , several kinds of radio systems and , in some cases , television , link all vital points .
Alternate locations exist for all key command centers .
For last-ditch emergencies SAC has alternate command posts on KC-135 jet tankers .
Multiple circuits , routings and frequencies make the chain as unbreakable as possible .
The same principle of `` redundancy '' applies to all communications on these special networks .
And no messages can be transmitted on these circuits until senders and receivers authenticate in advance , by special codes , that the messages actually come from their purported sources .
Additional codes can be used to challenge and counterchallenge the authentications .
Only the President is permitted to authorize the use of nuclear weapons .
That's the law .
But what if somebody decides to break it ? ?
The President cannot personally remove the safety devices from every nuclear trigger .
He makes the momentous decision .
Hundreds of men are required to pass the word to the button pushers and to push the buttons .
What if one or more of them turn irrational or suddenly , coolly , decide to clobber the Russians ? ?
What if the President himself , in the language of the military , `` goes ape '' ? ?
Or singlehandedly decided to reverse national policy and hit the Soviets without provocation ? ?
Nobody can be absolutely certain of the answers .
However , the system is designed , ingeniously and hopefully , so that no one man could initiate a thermonuclear war .
Even the President cannot pick up his telephone and give a `` go '' order .
Even he does not know the one signal for a nuclear strike -- the `` go code '' .
In an emergency he would receive available intelligence on the `` gold-phone circuit '' .
A system of `` gold '' -- actually yellow -- phones connects him with the offices and action stations of the Secretary of Defense , the Joint Chiefs of Staff , the SAC commander and other key men .
All can be connected with the gold circuit from their homes .
All could help the President make his decision .
The talk would not be in code , but neither would it ramble .
Vital questions would be quickly answered according to a preprepared agenda .
Officers who participate in the continual practice drills assured me that the President's decision could be made and announced on the gold circuit within minutes after the first flash from Aj .
If communications work , his decision would be instantly known in all command posts that would originate the actual go order .
For these centers , too , are on the gold circuit .
They include the Navy's Atlantic Command at Norfolk , Virginia , which is in contact with the Polaris subs ; ;
NATO headquarters in Europe ; ;
Air Force forward headquarters in Europe and in the Pacific , which control tactical fighters on ships and land bases ; ;
and SAC , which controls long-range bombers and Atlas missiles .
Let us look in on one of these nerve centers -- SAC at Omaha -- and see what must still happen before a wing of B-52 bombers could drop their Aj .
In a word , plenty .
The key man almost certainly would be Col. William W. Wisman , SAC's senior controller .
He or his deputy or one of their seven assistants , all full colonels , mans the heart of the command post twenty-four hours a day .
It is a quiet but impressive room -- 140 feet long , thirty-nine feet wide , twenty-one feet high .
Movable panels of floor-to-ceiling maps and charts are crammed with intelligence information .
And Bill Wisman , forty-three , a farmer's son from Beallsville , Ohio , is a quiet but impressive man .
His eyes are steady anchors of the deepest brown .
His movements and speech are precise , clear and quick .
No question ruffles him or causes him to hesitate .
Wisman , who has had the chief controller's job for four years , calls the signals for a team operating three rows of dull-gray consoles studded with lights , switches and buttons .
At least a dozen men , some armed , are never far away from him .
In front of him is a gold phone .
In emergencies the SAC commander , Gen. Thomas Power , or his deputies and their staff would occupy a balcony that stretches across the length of the room above Wisman and his staff .
At General Power's seat in the balcony there is also a gold phone .
General Power would participate in the decision making .
Wisman , below , would listen in and act .
His consoles can give him instant contact with more than seventy bases around the world and with every SAC aircraft .
He need only pick up one of the two red telephone receivers at his extreme left , right next to the big red button marked alert .
( There are two receivers in case one should be dropped and damaged .
)
But Wisman , too , does not know the go code .
He must take it from `` the red box '' .
In point of fact , this is a beige box with a bright red door , about one and a half feet square and hung from the wall about six feet from the door to Wisman's right .
The box is internally wired so the door can never be opened without setting off a screeching klaxon ( `` It's real obnoxious '' ) .
Now we must become vague , for we are approaching one of the nation's most guarded secrets .
The codes in the red box -- there are several of them covering various contingencies -- are contained in a sealed X-ray-proof `` unique device '' .
They are supplied , a batch at a time , by a secret source and are continually changed by Wisman or his staff , at random intervals .
But even the contents of Wisman's box cannot start a war .
They are mere fragments , just one portion of preprepared messages .
What these fragments are and how they activate the go order may not be revealed .
The pieces must be placed in the context of the prepared messages by Wisman's staff .
In addition to the authentication and acknowledgment procedures which precede and follow the sending of the go messages , again in special codes , each message also contains an `` internal authenticator '' , another specific signal to convince the recipient that he is getting the real thing .
I asked Wisman what would happen if he broke out the go codes and tried to start transmitting one .
`` I'd wind up full of bullet holes '' , he said , and there was no question that he was talking about bullets fired by his coworkers .
Now let us imagine a wing of B-52's , on alert near their `` positive control ( or fail-safe ) points '' , the spots on the map , many miles from Soviet territory , beyond which they are forbidden to fly without specific orders to proceed to their targets .
They , too , have fragments of the go code with them .
As Wisman put it , `` They have separate pieces of the pie , and we have the whole pie .
Once we send out the whole pie , they can put their pieces into it .
Unless we send out the whole pie , their pieces mean nothing '' .
Why does Wisman's ever-changing code always mesh with the fragments in possession of the button pushers ? ?
The answer is a cryptographic secret .
At any rate , three men out of a six-man B-52 crew are required to copy down Wisman's go-to-war message .
Each must match Wisman's `` pie '' with the fragment that he carries with him .
All three must compare notes and agree to `` go '' .
After that , it requires several minutes of concentrated work , including six separate and deliberate actions by a minimum of three men sitting at three separate stations in a bomber , each with another man beside him to help , for an armed bomb to be released .
Unless all gadgets are properly operated -- and the wires and seals from the handles removed first -- no damage can be done .
Suddenly , however , their posture changed and the game ended .
They went as rigid as black statuary six figures , lean and tall and angular , went still .
Their heads were in the air sniffing .
They all swung at the same instant in the same direction .
They saw it before I did , even with my binoculars .
It was nothing more than a tiny distant rain squall , a dull gray sheet which reached from a layer of clouds to the earth .
In the 360 degrees of horizon it obscured only a degree , no more .
A white man would not have seen it .
The aborigines fastened upon it with a concentration beyond pathos .
Watching , they waited until the squall thickened and began to move in a long drifting slant across the dry burning land .
At once the whole band set off at a lope .
They were chasing a rain cloud .
They went after the squall as mercilessly as a wolf pack after an abandoned cow .
I followed them in the jeep and now they did not care .
The games were over , this was life .
Occasionally , for no reason that I could see , they would suddenly alter the angle of their trot .
Sometimes I guessed it was because the rain squall had changed direction .
Sometimes it was to skirt a gulley .
Their gait is impossible to convey in words .
It has nothing of the proud stride of the trained runner about it , it is not a lope , it is not done with style or verve .
It is the gait of the human who must run to live : arms dangling , legs barely swinging over the ground , head hung down and only occasionally swinging up to see the target , a loose motion that is just short of stumbling and yet is wonderfully graceful .
It is a barely controlled skimming of the ground .
They ran for three hours .
Finally , avoiding hummocks and seeking low ground , they intercepted the rain squall .
For ten minutes they ran beneath the squall , raising their arms and , for the first time , shouting and capering .
Then the wind died and the rain squall held steady .
They were studying the ground .
Suddenly one of them shouted , ran a few feet , bent forward and put his mouth to the ground .
He had found a depression with rain water in it .
He bent down , a black cranelike figure , and put his mouth to the ground .
With a lordly and generous gesture , the discoverer stood up and beckoned to the closest of his fellows .
The other trotted over and swooped at the tiny puddle .
In an instant he had sucked it dry .
The aborigine lives on the cruelest land I have ever seen .
Which does not mean that it is ugly .
Part of it is , of course .
There are thousands of square miles of salt pan which are hideous .
They are huge areas which have been swept by winds for so many centuries that there is no soil left , but only deep bare ridges fifty or sixty yards apart with ravines between them thirty or forty feet deep and the only thing that moves is a scuttling layer of sand .
Such stretches have an inhuman moonlike quality .
But much of the land which the aborigine wanders looks as if it should be hospitable .
It is softened by the saltbush and the bluebush , has a peaceful quality , the hills roll softly .
The malignancy of such a landscape has been beautifully described by the Australian Charles Bean .
He tells of three men who started out on a trip across a single paddock , a ten-by-ten-mile square owned by a sheep grazer .
They went well-equipped with everything except knowledge of the `` outback '' country .
``
The countryside looked like a beautiful open park with gentle slopes and soft gray tree-clumps .
Nothing appalling or horrible rushed upon these men .
Only there happened -- nothing .
There might have been a pool of cool water behind any of these tree-clumps : only -- there was not .
It might have rained , any time ; ;
only -- it did not .
There might have been a fence or a house just over the next rise ; ;
only -- there was not .
They lay , with the birds hopping from branch to branch above them and the bright sky peeping down at them .
No one came '' .
The white men died .
And countless others like them have died .
Even today range riders will come upon mummified bodies of men who attempted nothing more difficult than a twenty-mile hike and slowly lost direction , were tortured by the heat , driven mad by the constant and unfulfilled promise of the landscape , and who finally died .
The aborigine is not deceived ; ;
he knows that the land is hard and pitiless .
He knows that the economy of life in the `` outback '' is awful .
There is no room for error or waste .
Any organism that falters or misperceives the signals or weakens is done .
I do not know if such a way of life can come to be a self-conscious challenge , but I suspect that it can .
Perhaps this is what gives the aborigine his odd air of dignity .
The family at the boulder
seeing an aborigine today is a difficult thing .
Many of them have drifted into the cities and towns and seaports .
Others are confined to vast reservations , and not only does the Australian government justifiably not wish them to be viewed as exhibits in a zoo , but on their reservations they are extremely fugitive , shunning camps , coming together only for corroborees at which their strange culture comes to its highest pitch -- which is very low indeed .
I persuaded an Australian friend who had lived `` outback '' for years to take me to see some aborigines living in the bush .
It was a difficult and ambiguous kind of negotiation , even though the rancher was said to be expert in his knowledge of the aborigines and their language .
Finally , however , the arrangements were made and we drove out into the bush in a Land Rover .
We followed the asphalt road for a few miles and then swung off onto a smaller road which was nothing more than two tire marks on the earth .
The rancher went a mile down this road and then , when he reached a big red boulder , swung off the road .
At once he started to glance toward the instrument panel .
It took me a moment to realize what was odd about that panel : there was a gimbaled compass welded to it , which rocked gently back and forth as the Land Rover bounced about .
The rancher was navigating his way across the flatland .
`` Do you always navigate like this '' ? ?
I asked .
`` Damned right '' , he said .
`` Once I get out on the flat I do .
Some chaps that know an area well can make their way by landmarks , a tree here , a wash here , a boulder there .
But if you don't know the place like the palm of your hand , you'd better use a compass and the speedometer .
Two miles northeast , then five miles southwest that sort of thing .
Very simple '' .
He was right .
The landscape kept repeating itself .
I would try to memorize landmarks and saw in a half-hour that it was hopeless .
Finally we approached the bivouac of the aborigines .
They were camped beside a large column-shaped boulder : a man , his lubra , and two children .
The sun was not yet high and all of them were in the small area of shade cast by the boulder .
There was also a dog , a dingo dog .
Its ribs showed , it was a yellow nondescript color , it suffered from a variety of sores , hair had scabbed off its body in patches .
It lay with its head on its paws and only its eyes moving , watching us carefully .
It struck me as a very bright and very malnourished dog .
No one patted the dog .
It was not a pet .
It was a worker .
`` The buggers love shade '' , the rancher said .
`` I suppose because it saves them some loss of body water .
They'll move around that rock all day , following the shade .
During the hottest part of the day , of course , the sun comes straight down and there isn't any shade '' .
We drove close to the boulder , stopped the Land Rover , and walked over toward the family .
The man was leaning against the rock .
He gazed away from us as we approached .
He was over six feet tall and very thin .
His legs were narrow and very long .
Every bone and muscle in his body showed , but he did not give the appearance of starving .
He had long black hair and a wispy beard .
The ridges over his eyes were huge and his eyelids were half shut .
There was something about his face that disturbed me and it took several seconds to realize what .
It was not merely that flies were crawling over his face but his narrowed eyelids did not blink when the flies crawled into his eye sockets .
A fly would crawl down the bulging forehead , into the socket of the eye , walk along the man's lashes and across the wet surface of the eyeball , and the eye did not blink .
The Australian and I both were wearing insect repellent and were not badly bothered by insects , but my eyes watered as we stood watching the aborigine .
I turned to look at the lubra .
She remained squatting on her heels all the time we were there ; ;
like the man , she was entirely naked .
Her long thin arms moved in a slow rhythmical gesture over the family possessions which were placed in front of her .
There were two rubbing sticks for making fire , two stones shaped roughly like knives , a woven-root container which held a few pounds of dried worms and the dead body of some rodent .
There was also a long wooden spear and a woomera , a spear-throwing device which gives the spear an enormous velocity and high accuracy .
There was also a boomerang , elaborately carved .
Everything was burnished with sweat and grease so that all of the objects seemed to have been carved from the same material and to be ageless .
The two children , both boys , wandered around the Australian and me for a few moments and then returned to their work .
They squatted on their heels with their heads bent far forward , their eyes only a few inches from the ground .
They had located the runway of a colony of ants and as the ants came out of the ground , the boys picked them up , one at a time , and pinched them dead .
The tiny bodies , dropped onto a dry leaf , made a pile as big as a small apple .
The odor here was more powerful than that which surrounded the town aborigines .
The smell at first was more surprising than unpleasant .
It was also subtly familiar , for it was the odor of the human body , but multiplied innumerable times because of the fact that the aborigines never bathed .
One's impulse is to say that the smell was a stink and unpleasant .
But that is a cliche and a dishonest one .
The smell is sexual , but so powerfully so that a civilized nose must deny it .
Their skin was covered with a thin coating of sweat and dirt which had almost the consistency of a second skin .
They roll at night in ashes to keep warm and their second skin has a light dusty cast to it .
In spots such as the elbows and knees the second skin is worn off and I realized the aborigines were much darker than they appeared ; ;
as if the coating of sweat , dirt , and ashes were a cosmetic .
The boys had beautiful dark eyes and unlike their father they brushed constantly at the flies and blinked their eyes .
`` That smell is something , eh , mate '' ? ?
The Australian asked .
`` They swear that every person smells different and every family smells different from every other .
At the corroborees , when they get to dancing and sweating , you'll see them rubbing up against a man who's supposed to have a specially good smell .
Idje , here '' , and he nodded at the man , `` is said to have great odor .
The stink is all the same to me , but I really think they can make one another out blindfolded '' .
`` Here , Idje , you fella like tabac '' ? ?
He said sharply .
Idje still stared over our shoulders at the horizon .
The Australian stopped trying to talk a pidgin I could understand , and spoke strange words from deep in his chest .
It was a fortunate time in which to build , for the seventeenth century was a great period in Persian art .
The architects , the tile and carpet makers , the potters , painters , calligraphers , and metalsmiths worked through Abbas's reign and those of his successors to enrich the city .
Travelers entering from the desert were confounded by what must have seemed an illusion : a great garden filled with nightingales and roses , cut by canals and terraced promenades , studded with water tanks of turquoise tile in which were reflected the glistening blue curves of a hundred domes .
At the heart of all of this was the square , which one such traveler declared to be `` as spacious , as pleasant and aromatick a Market as any in the Universe '' .
In time Isfahan came to be known as `` half the world '' , Isfahan nisf-i-jahan .
In the early eighteenth century this fantastic city , then the size of London , started to decline .
The Afghans invaded ; ;
the Safavids fell from power ; ;
the capital went elsewhere ; ;
the desert encroached .
Isfahan became more of a legend than a place , and now it is for many people simply a name to which they attach their notions of old Persia and sometimes of the East .
They think of it as a kind of spooky museum in which they may half see and half imagine the old splendor .
Those who actually get there find that it isn't spooky at all but as brilliant as a tile in sunlight .
But even for them it remains a museum , or perhaps it would be more accurate to say a tomb , a tomb in which Persia lies well preserved but indeed dead .
Everyone is ready to grant the Persians their history , but almost no one is willing to acknowledge their present .
It seems that for Persia , and especially for this city , there are only two times : the glorious past and the corrupt , depressing , sterile present .
The one apparent connection between the two is a score of buildings which somehow or other have survived and which naturally enough are called `` historical monuments '' .
However , just as all the buildings have not fallen and flowed back to their original mud , so the values which wanted them and saw that they were built have not all disappeared .
The values and talents which made the tile and the dome , the rug , the poem and the miniature , continue in certain social institutions which rise above the ordinary life of this city , as the great buildings rise above blank walls and dirty lanes .
Often , too , the social institutions are housed in these pavilions and palaces and bridges , for these great structures are not simply `` historical monuments '' ; ;
they are the places where Persians live .
The promenade , for example , continues to take place on the Chahar Bagh , a mile-long garden of plane and poplar trees that now serves as the city's principal street .
It takes place as well along the terraces and through the arcades of the Khaju bridge , and also in the gardens of the square .
On Fridays , the day when many Persians relax with poetry , talk , and a samovar , people do not , it is true , stream into Chehel Sotun -- a pavilion and garden built by Shah Abbas 2 , in the seventeenth century -- but they do retire into hundreds of pavilions throughout the city and up the river valley , which are smaller , more humble copies of the former .
And of course religious life continues to center in the more famous mosques , and commercial life -- very much a social institution -- in the bazaar .
Those three other great activities of the Persians , the bath , the teahouse , and the zur khaneh ( the latter a kind of club in which a leader and a group of men in an octagonal pit move through a rite of calisthenics , dance , chanted poetry , and music ) , do not take place in buildings to which entrance tickets are sold , but some of them occupy splendid examples of Persian domestic architecture : long , domed , chalk-white rooms with daises of turquoise tile , their end walls cut through to the orchards and the sky by open arches .
But more important , and the thing which the casual traveler and the blind sojourner often do not see , is that these places and activities are often the settings in which Persians exercise their extraordinary aesthetic sensibilities .
Water , air , fruit , poetry , music , the human form -- these things are important to Persians , and they experience them with an intense and discriminating awareness .
I should like , by the way , to make it clear that I am not using the word `` Persians '' carelessly .
I don't mean a few aesthetes who play about with sensations , like a young prince in a miniature dabbling his hand in a pool .
These things are important to almost all Persians and perhaps most important to the most ordinary .
The men crying love poems in an orchard on any summer's night are as often as not the lutihaw , mustachioed toughs who spend most of their lives in and out of the local prisons , brothels , and teahouses .
A few months ago it was a fairly typical landlord who in the dead of night lugged me up a mountainside to drink from a spring famous in the neighborhood for its clarity and flavor .
Not long ago an acquaintance , a slick-headed water rat of a lad up from the maw of the city , stood on the balcony puffing his first cigarette in weeks .
The air , he said , was just right ; ;
a cigarette would taste particularly good .
I really didn't know what he meant .
It was a nice day , granted .
But he knew ; ;
he sniffed the air and licked it on his lip and knew as a vintner knows a vintage .
The natural world then , plus poetry and some kinds of art , receives from the most ordinary of Persians a great deal of attention .
The line of an eyebrow , the color of the skin , a ghazal from Hafiz , the purity of spring water , the long afternoon among the boughs which crowd the upper story of a pavilion -- these things are noticed , judged , and valued .
Nowhere in Isfahan is this rich aesthetic life of the Persians shown so well as during the promenade at the Khaju bridge .
There has probably always been a bridge of some sort at the southeastern corner of the city .
For one thing , there is a natural belt of rock across the river bed ; ;
for another , it was here that one of the old caravan routes came in .
It was to provide a safe and spacious crossing for these caravans , and also to make a pleasance for the city , that Shah Abbas 2 , in about 1657 built , of sun-baked brick , tile , and stone , the present bridge .
It is a splendid structure .
From upstream it looks like a long arcaded box laid across the river ; ;
from downstream , where the water level is much lower , it is a high , elaborately facaded pavilion .
The top story contains more than thirty alcoves separated from each other by spandrels of blue and yellow tile .
At either end and in the center there are bays which contain nine greater alcoves as frescoed and capacious as church apses .
Here , in the old days -- when they had come to see the moon or displays of fireworks -- sat the king and his court while priests , soldiers , and other members of the party lounged in the smaller alcoves between .
Below , twenty vaults tunnel through the understructure of the bridge .
These are traversed by another line of vaults , and thus rooms , arched on all four sides , are formed .
Down through the axis of the bridge there is a long diminishing vista like a visual echo of piers and arches , while the vaults fronting upstream and down frame the sunset and sunrise , the mountains and river pools .
Here , on the hottest day , it is cool beneath the stone and fresh from the water flowing in the sluices at the bottom of the vaults .
On the downstream , or `` pavilion '' , side these vaults give out onto terraces twice as wide as the bridge itself .
From the terraces -- eighteen in all -- broad flights of steps descend into the water or onto still more terraces barely above the level of the river .
Out of water , brick , and tile they have made far more than just a bridge .
On spring and summer evenings people leave their shops and houses and walk up through the lanes of the city to the bridge .
It is a great spectacle .
The bridge itself rises up from the river , light-flared and enormous , like the outdoor set for an epic opera .
Crowds press along the terraces , down the steps , in and out of the arcades , massing against it as though it were a fortress under siege .
All kinds come to walk in the promenade : merchants from the bazaar bickering over a deal ; ;
a Bakhtiari khan in a cap and hacking jacket ; ;
dervishes who stand with the stillness of the blind , their eyes filmed with rheum and visions ; ;
the old Kajar princes arriving in their ancient limousines ; ;
students , civil servants , beggars , musicians , hawkers , and clowns .
Families go out to the edge of the terraces to sit on carpets around a samovar .
Below , people line the steps , as though on bleachers , to watch the sky and river .
Above , in the tiled prosceniums of the alcoves , boys sing the ghazals of Hafiz and Saadi , while at the very bottom , in the vaults , the toughs and blades of the city hoot and bang their drums , drink arak , play dice , and dance .
Here in an evening Persians enjoy many of the things which are important to them : poetry , water , the moon , a beautiful face .
To a stranger their delight in these things may seem paradoxical , for Persians chase the golden calf as much as any people .
Many of them , moreover , are beginning to complain about the scarcity of Western amusements and to ridicule the old life of the bazaar merchant , the mullah , and the peasant .
Nonetheless , they take time out -- much time -- from the game of grab and these new Western experiments to go to the gardens and riverbanks .
Above all , they will stop in the middle of anything , anywhere , to hear or quote some poetry .
Poetry in Persian life is far more than a common ground on which -- in a society deeply fissured by antagonisms -- all may stand .
It contains , in fact , their whole outlook on life .
And it is expressed , at least to their taste , in a perfect form .
Poetry for a Persian is nothing less than truth and beauty .
In most Western cultures today these twins have been sent away to the libraries and museums .
In Persia , where practically speaking there are no museums or libraries or , for that matter , hardly any books , the twins run free .
It is perhaps difficult to conceive , but imagine that tonight on London bridge the Teddy boys of the East End will gather to sing Marlowe , Herrick , Shakespeare , and perhaps some lyrics of their own .
That , at any rate , is what happens at the Khaju bridge .
Boys and men go along the riverbank or to the alcoves in the top arcade .
Here in these little rooms -- or stages arched open to the sky and river -- they choose a few lines out of the hundreds they may know and sing them according to one of the modes into which Persian music is divided .
Each mode is believed to have a specific attribute -- one inducing pleasure , another generosity , another love , and so on , to include all of the emotions .
The singer simply matches the poem to a mode ; ;
for example , the mode of bravery to this anonymous folk poem : `` They brought me news that Spring is in the plains And Ahmad's blood the crimson tulip stains ; ;
Go , tell his aged mother that her son Fought with a thousand foes , and he was one '' .
Or the mode of love to this fragment by a recent poet : `` Know ye , fair folk who dwell on earth Or shall hereafter come to birth , That here , with dust upon his eyes , Iraj , the sweet-tongued singer , lies .
In this true lover's tomb interred A world of love lies sepulchred .
''
These songs ( practically all Persian music , for that matter ) are limited to a range of two octaves .
Yet within this limitation there is an astonishing variety : design as intricate as that in the carpet or miniature , with the melodic line like the painted or woven line often flowing into an arabesque .
Die Frist ist um , und wiederum verstrichen sind sieben Jahr , the Maestro quoted The Flying Dutchman , as he told of his career and wanderings , explaining that the number seven had significantly recurred in his life several times .
The music director of the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra , William Steinberg , has molded his group into a prominent musical organization , which is his life .
When he added to his Pittsburgh commitments the directorship of the London Philharmonic Orchestra in 1958 , he conducted one hundred fifty concerts within nine months , `` commuting '' between the two cities .
This schedule became too strenuous , even for the energetic and conscientious Mr. Steinberg .
His London contract was rescinded , and now , he explains cheerfully , as a bright smile lightens his intense , mobile face , `` I conduct only one hundred and twenty concerts '' ! !
Our meeting took place in May , 1961 , during one of the Maestro's stop-overs in New York , before he left for Europe .
As we began to converse in the lounge of his Fifth Avenue hotel , his restlessness and sensitivity to light and sound became immediately apparent .
Seeking an obscure , dark , relatively quiet corner in the airy room otherwise suffused with afternoon sunshine , he asked if the soft background music could be turned off .
Unfortunately , it was Muzak , which automatically is piped into the public rooms , and which nolens volens had to be endured .
As he talked about himself , time and again stuffing and dragging on his pipe , Steinberg began to relax and the initial hurried feeling grew faint and was dispelled .
Did he come from a musical family ? ?
Yes : though not professional musicians , they were a music-loving family .
In his native Cologne , where his mother taught him to play the piano , he was able to read notes before he learned the alphabet .
She even devised a system of colors , whereby the boy could easily distinguish the different note values .
When he started school at the age of five-and-a-half , he could not understand why the alphabet begins with the letter A , instead of C , as in the scale .
Because , like many other children , he intensely disliked practicing Czerny Etudes , he composed his own studies .
When he was eight he began violin lessons .
Soon he was playing in the Cologne Municipal Orchestra , and during World War 1 , , when musicians were scarce , he joined the opera orchestra as well .
Steinberg claims that these early years of orchestra participation were of invaluable help to his career .
`` By observing the conductor '' , he says with a twinkle in his eyes , `` I learned how not to conduct '' .
The musician ran away from school when he was fifteen , but this escapade did not save him from the Gymnasium .
Simultaneously , he pursued his musical studies at the conservatory , receiving sound training in counterpoint and harmony , as well in the violin and piano .
His professional career began when he was twenty ; ;
he became Otto Klemperer's personal assistant at the Cologne Opera , and a year later was promoted to the position of regular conductor .
Wasn't this an unusually young age to fill such a responsible post ? ?
Yes , the Maestro assented .
Had he always wished to be a conductor ? ?
No , originally he had hoped to become a concert pianist and had even performed as such .
However , when he assumed the duties of a conductor , he relinquished his career as a pianist .
Five years were spent with the Cologne Opera , after which he was called to Prague by Alexander von Zemlinsky , teacher of Arnold Schonberg and Erich Korngold .
In 1927 he succeeded Zemlinsky as opera director of the German Theater at Prague .
During his tenure he also fulfilled guest engagements at the Berlin State Opera .
Two years later he became director of the Frankfurt Opera , where he remained until he lost this position in 1933 through the rise of the Hitler regime .
During these years the youthful conductor had contributed greatly to the high level of musical life in Germany .
He had presented the first German performances of Puccini's Manon Lescaut and De Falla's La Vida Breve .
The Frankfurt years were particularly noteworthy for his performance of Berg's Wozzek soon after the Berlin premiere under Erich Kleiber , and the world premiere of Schonberg's Von heute auf morgen .
At the outset of his career , Steinberg had dedicated himself to the advancement of contemporary music by vowing to do a Schonberg work every year .
In Frankfurt , too , he directed the Museum and Opera House concerts which , in addition to the standard repertoire , featured novelties like Erdmann's Piano Concerto and Mahler's Sixth Symphony .
Because of the political upheaval in Germany in the 1930's , Steinberg was forced to restrict his activities to the Jewish community .
Through the Frankfurt Jewish Kulturbund he began to give sonata recitals in synagogues , with Cellist Emanuel Feuermann .
As more and more Jewish musicians lost their jobs with professional organizations Steinberg united them into the Frankfurt Kulturbund Orchestra , which also gave guest performances in other German cities .
In 1936 he accepted the leadership of the Berlin Kulturbund .
In the fall of that year the best musicians of the Berlin and Frankfurt Kulturbund orchestras joined under the combined efforts of Bronislaw Hubermann and Steinberg to become the Palestine Orchestra -- now known as the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra -- with Steinberg as founder-conductor .
In 1938 , at the insistence of Arturo Toscanini , Steinberg left Germany for the United States , by way of Switzerland .
After he had spent the first three years in New York as associate conductor , at Toscanini's invitation , of the NBC Orchestra , he made numerous guest appearances throughout the United States and Latin America .
In 1945 he became conductor of the Buffalo Philharmonic .
Seven years later he was asked to become director of the Pittsburgh Symphony .
Since 1944 he has also conducted regularly at the San Francisco Opera , where he made his debut with a memorable performance of Verdi's Falstaff .
In recent years he has traveled widely in Europe , conducting in Italy , France , Austria , and Switzerland .
He returned to Germany for the first time in 1953 , where he has since conducted in Cologne , Frankfurt , and Berlin .
Where in Europe was he going now ? ?
First of all , to Italy for a short vacation -- Forte Dei Marmi , a place he loves .
Since it is not far from Viareggio , he will visit Puccini's house , as he never fails to do , to pay his respects to the memory of the composer of La Boheme , which he considers one of Puccini's masterpieces .
Steinberg spoke with warmth and enthusiasm about Italy : `` Rome is my second home .
I consider it the center of the world and make it a point to be there once a year '' .
He will conduct two concerts at the Accademia Di Santa Cecilia , as well as concerts in Munich and Cologne .
`` Then I return to the United States for engagements at the Hollywood Bowl and in Philadelphia '' , he added .
The forthcoming season in Pittsburgh also promises to be of unusual interest .
There will be premieres of new works , made possible through Ford Foundation commissions : Carlisle Floyd's Mystery , with Phyllis Curtin as soprano soloist .
Other world premieres will be Gardner Read's Third Symphony and Burle Marx's Samba Concertante .
`` And next year we will do -- also a Ford commission -- a piano concerto by Elliott Carter , with Jacob Lateiner as soloist .
Of course , I shall conduct Mahler and Bruckner works in the coming season , as usual .
We'll play Bruckner's Fifth Symphony in the original version , and Mahler's Seventh -- the least accessible , known , and played of Mahler's works .
My Pittsburghers have become real addicts to Mahler and Bruckner '' .
He added that he also stresses the works of these favorite masters on tour , especially Mahler's First and Fourth symphonies , and Das Lied Von der Erde , and Bruckner's Sixth -- which is rarely played -- and Seventh .
Bruckner's Eighth he refers to as `` my travel symphony '' .
He recalled that in California after a critic had attacked him for `` still trying to sell Bruckner to the Americans '' , the public's response at the next concert was a standing ovation .
`` Now that Bruno Walter is virtually in retirement and my dear friend Dimitri Mitropoulos is no longer with us , I am probably the only one -- with the possible exception of Leonard Bernstein -- who has this special affinity for and champions the works of Bruckner and Mahler '' .
Since he introduces so much modern music , I could not resist asking how he felt about it .
`` There was always and at all times a contemporary music and it expresses the era in which it was created .
But I usually stick to the old phrase : ' Ich habe ein Amt , aber keine Meinung ( I hold an office , but I do not feel entitled to have an opinion ) .
I consider it to be my job to expose the public to what is being written today '' .
With all his musical activities , did he have the time and inclination to do anything else ? ?
He had just paid a brief visit to the Frick Collection to admire his favorite paintings by Rembrandt and Franz Hals .
He was not enthusiastic over the newly acquired Claude Lorrain , but reminisced with pleasure over a Poussin exhibit he had been able to see in Paris a year ago .
And how did he feel about modern art ? ?
Again Steinberg was cautious and replied with a smile that he was not exposed to it enough to hazard comments .
`` As my wife puts it '' , he said , again with a twinkle in his eyes , `` all you know is your music .
But after all , you never learned anything else '' ! !
What did he do for relaxation ? ?
Like his late colleague , Mitropoulos , he reads mystery stories , in particular Sir Arthur Conan Doyle .
He cited Heine and Stendhal as favorites in literature .
But his prime interest , apart from music , he insisted seriously , was his family -- his wife , daughter and son .
At the moment he was excited about his son's having received the Prix De Rome in archaeology and was looking forward to being present this summer at the excavation of an Etruscan tomb .
`` Both children are musical and my wife is a music lover of unfailing instinct and judgement '' .
`` Is the attitude of German youth comparable to that of `` the angry young men ' of England '' ? ?
Was the topic for a round-table discussion at the Bayerische Rundfunk in Munich .
I was chairman , the only not youthful participant .
Since attack serves to stimulate interest in broadcasts , I added to my opening statement a sentence in which I claimed that German youth seemed to lack the enthusiasm which is a necessary ingredient of anger , and might be classified as uninterested and bored rather than angry .
I was far from convinced of the truth of my statement , but could not think of anything that might evoke responses more quickly .
`` It is easy for you to talk '' ; ;
countered a twenty year old law student , `` you travel around the world .
We would like to do that too '' .
`` But you want a job guaranteed when you return '' , I continued my attack .
`` You must have some security '' , said a young clerk .
When I mentioned that for my first long voyage I did not even have the money for the return fare , but had trusted to luck that I would earn a sufficient amount , the young people looked at me doubtingly .
One girl expressed what was obviously in their minds .
`` Would you advise us to act the same way ? ?
You might have failed .
I think it is rather foolhardy to trust to luck '' .
Others mentioned that I might have had to ask friends or even strangers for help and that to be stranded in a foreign country without sufficient funds did not contribute to international understanding .
The debate needed no additional controversy and soon I could ask each individually what he expected from life , what his hopes were and what his fears .
Though the four boys and two girls , the youngest nineteen years of age , the oldest twenty-four , came from varying backgrounds and had different professional and personal interests , there was surprising agreement among them .
What they wished for most was security ; ;
what they feared most was war or political instability in their own country .
The ideal home , they agreed , would be a small private house or a city apartment of four to five rooms , just enough for a family consisting of husband , wife , and two children .
No one wanted a larger family or no children , and none hoped for a castle or said that living in less settled circumstances would be satisfactory .
All expressed interest in world affairs but no one offered to make any sacrifices to satisfy this interest .
Once again , as in the days of the Founding Fathers , America faces a stern test .
That test , as President Kennedy forthrightly depicted it in his State of the Union message , will determine `` whether a nation organized and governed such as ours can endure '' .
It is well then that in this hour both of `` national peril '' and of `` national opportunity '' we can take counsel with the men who made the nation .
Incapable of self-delusion , the Founding Fathers found the crisis of their time to be equally grave , and yet they had confidence that America would surmount it and that a republic of free peoples would prosper and serve as an example to a world aching for liberty .
Seven Founders -- George Washington , Benjamin Franklin , John Adams , Thomas Jefferson , Alexander Hamilton , James Madison and John Jay -- determined the destinies of the new nation .
In certain respects , their task was incomparably greater than ours today , for there was nobody before them to show them the way .
As Madison commented to Jefferson in 1789 , `` We are in a wilderness without a single footstep to guide us .
Our successors will have an easier task '' .
They thought of themselves , to use Jefferson's words , as `` the Argonauts '' who had lived in `` the Heroic Age '' .
Accordingly , they took special pains to preserve their papers as essential sources for posterity .
Their writings assume more than dramatic or patriotic interest because of their conviction that the struggle in which they were involved was neither selfish nor parochial but , rather , as Washington in his last wartime circular reminded his fellow countrymen , that `` with our fate will the destiny of unborn millions be involved '' .
Strong men with strong opinions , frank to the point of being refreshingly indiscreet , the Founding Seven were essentially congenial minds , and their agreements with each other were more consequential than their differences .
Even though in most cases the completion of the definitive editions of their writings is still years off , enough documentation has already been assembled to warrant drawing a new composite profile of the leadership which performed the heroic dual feats of winning American independence and founding a new nation .
Before merging them into a common profile it is well to remember that their separate careers were extraordinary .
Certainly no other seven American statesmen from any later period achieved so much in so concentrated a span of years .
Eldest of the seven , Benjamin Franklin , a New Englander transplanted to Philadelphia , wrote the most dazzling success story in our history .
The young printer's apprentice achieved greatness in a half-dozen different fields , as editor and publisher , scientist , inventor , philanthropist and statesman .
Author of the Albany Plan Of Union , which , had it been adopted , might have avoided the Revolution , he fought the colonists' front-line battles in London , negotiated the treaty of alliance with France and the peace that ended the war , headed the state government of Pennsylvania , and exercised an important moderating influence at the Federal Convention .
On a military mission for his native Virginia the youthful George Washington touched off the French and Indian War , then guarded his colony's frontier as head of its militia .
Commanding the Continental Army for six long years of the Revolution , he was the indispensable factor in the ultimate victory .
Retiring to his beloved Mount Vernon , he returned to preside over the Federal Convention , and was the only man in history to be unanimously elected President .
During his two terms the Constitution was tested and found workable , strong national policies were inaugurated , and the traditions and powers of the Presidential office firmly fixed .
John Adams fashioned much of pre-Revolutionary radical ideology , wrote the constitution of his home state of Massachusetts , negotiated , with Franklin and Jay , the peace with Britain and served as our first Vice President and our second President .
His political opponent and lifetime friend , Thomas Jefferson , achieved immortality through his authorship of the Declaration of Independence , but equally notable were the legal and constitutional reforms he instituted in his native Virginia , his role as father of our territorial system , and his acquisition of the Louisiana Territory during his first term as President .
During the greater part of Jefferson's career he enjoyed the close collaboration of a fellow Virginian , James Madison , eight years his junior .
The active sponsor of Jefferson's measure for religious liberty in Virginia , Madison played the most influential single role in the drafting of the Constitution and in securing its ratification in Virginia , founded the first political party in American history , and , as Jefferson's Secretary of State and his successor in the Presidency , guided the nation through the troubled years of our second war with Britain .
If Franklin was an authentic genius , then Alexander Hamilton , with his exceptional precocity , consuming energy , and high ambition , was a political prodigy .
His revolutionary pamphlets , published when he was only 19 , quickly brought him to the attention of the patriot leaders .
Principal author of `` The Federalist '' , he swung New York over from opposition to the Constitution to ratification almost single-handedly .
His collaboration with Washington , begun when he was the general's aide during the Revolution , was resumed when he entered the first Cabinet as Secretary of the Treasury .
His bold fiscal program and his broad interpretation of the Constitution stand as durable contributions .
Less dazzling than Hamilton , less eloquent than Jefferson , John Jay commands an equally high rank among the Founding Fathers .
He served as president of the Continental Congress .
He played the leading role in negotiating the treaty with Great Britain that ended the Revolution , and directed America's foreign affairs throughout the Confederation period .
As first Chief Justice , his strong nationalist opinions anticipated John Marshall .
He ended his public career as a two-term governor of New York .
These Seven Founders constituted an intellectual and social elite , the most respectable and disinterested leadership any revolution ever confessed .
Their social status was achieved in some cases by birth , as with Washington , Jefferson and Jay ; ;
in others by business and professional acumen , as with Franklin and Adams , or , in Hamilton's case , by an influential marriage .
Unlike so many of the power-starved intellectuals in underdeveloped nations of our own day , they commanded both prestige and influence before the Revolution started .
As different physically as the tall , angular Jefferson was from the chubby , rotund Adams , the seven were striking individualists .
Ardent , opinionated , even obstinate , they were amazingly articulate , wrote their own copy , and were masters of phrasemaking .
Capable of enduring friendships , they were also stout controversialists , who could write with a drop of vitriol on their pens .
John Adams dismissed John Dickinson , who voted against the Declaration of Independence , as `` a certain great fortune and piddling genius '' .
Washington castigated his critic , General Conway , as being capable of `` all the meanness of intrigue to gratify the absurd resentment of disappointed vanity '' .
And Hamilton , who felt it `` a religious duty '' to oppose Aaron Burr's political ambitions , would have been a better actuarial risk had he shown more literary restraint .
The Seven Founders were completely dedicated to the public service .
Madison once remarked : `` My life has been so much a public one '' , a comment which fits the careers of the other six .
Franklin retired from editing and publishing at the age of 42 , and for the next forty-two years devoted himself to public , scientific , and philanthropic interests .
Washington never had a chance to work for an extended stretch at the occupation he loved best , plantation management .
He served as Commander in Chief during the Revolution without compensation .
John Adams took to heart the advice given him by his legal mentor , Jeremiah Gridley , to `` pursue the study of the law , rather than the gain of it '' .
In taking account of seventeen years of law practice , Adams concluded that `` no lawyer in America ever did so much business as I did '' and `` for so little profit '' .
When the Revolution broke out , he , along with Jefferson and Jay , abandoned his career at the bar , with considerable financial sacrifice .
Hamilton , poorest of the seven , gave up a brilliant law practice to enter Washington's Cabinet .
While he was handling the multi-million-dollar funding operations of the Government he had to resort to borrowing small sums from friends .
`` If you can conveniently let me have twenty dollars '' , he wrote one friend in 1791 when he was Secretary of the Treasury .
To support his large family Hamilton went back to the law after each spell of public service .
Talleyrand passed his New York law office one night on the way to a party .
Hamilton was bent over his desk , drafting a legal paper by the light of a candle .
The Frenchman was astonished .
`` I have just come from viewing a man who had made the fortune of his country , but now is working all night in order to support his family '' , he reflected .
All seven combined ardent devotion to the cause of revolution with a profound respect for legality .
John Adams asserted in the Continental Congress' Declaration of Rights that the demands of the colonies were in accordance with their charters , the British Constitution and the common law , and Jefferson appealed in the Declaration of Independence `` to the tribunal of the world '' for support of a revolution justified by `` the laws of nature and of nature's God '' .
They fought hard , but they were forgiving to former foes , and sought to prevent vindictive legislatures from confiscating Tory property in violation of the Treaty of 1783 .
This sense of moderation and fairness is superbly exemplified in an exchange of letters between John Jay and a Tory refugee , Peter Van Schaack .
Jay had participated in the decision that exiled his old friend Van Schaack .
Yet when , at war's end , the ex-Tory made the first move to resume correspondence , Jay wrote him from Paris , where he was negotiating the peace settlement :
`` As an independent American I considered all who were not for us , and you amongst the rest , as against us , yet be assured that John Jay never ceased to be the friend of Peter Van Schaack '' .
The latter in turn assured him that `` were I arraigned at the bar , and you my judge , I should expect to stand or fall only by the merits of my cause '' .
All seven recognized that independence was but the first step toward building a nation .
`` We have now a national character to establish '' , Washington wrote in 1783 .
`` Think continentally '' , Hamilton counseled the young nation .
This new force , love of country , super-imposed upon -- if not displacing -- affectionate ties to one's own state , was epitomized by Washington .
His first inaugural address speaks of `` my country whose voice I can never hear but with veneration and love '' .
All sought the fruition of that nationalism in a Federal Government with substantial powers .
Save Jefferson , all participated in the framing or ratification of the Federal Constitution .
They supported it , not as a perfect instrument , but as the best obtainable .
Historians have traditionally regarded the great debates of the Seventeen Nineties as polarizing the issues of centralized vs. limited government , with Hamilton and the nationalists supporting the former and Jefferson and Madison upholding the latter position .
The state's rights position was formulated by Jefferson and Madison in the Kentucky and Virginia Resolves , but in their later careers as heads of state the two proved themselves better Hamiltonians than Jeffersonians .
In purchasing Louisiana , Jefferson had to adopt Hamilton's broad construction of the Constitution , and so did Madison in advocating the rechartering of Hamilton's bank , which he had so strenuously opposed at its inception , and in adopting a Hamiltonian protective tariff .
Indeed , the old Jeffersonians were far more atune to the Hamilton-oriented Whigs than they were to the Jacksonian Democrats .
When , in 1832 , the South Carolina nullifiers adopted the principle of state interposition which Madison had advanced in his old Virginia Resolve , they elicited no encouragement from that senior statesman .
In his political testament , `` Advice To My Country '' , penned just before his death , Madison expressed the wish `` that the Union of the States be cherished and perpetuated .
Let the open enemy to it be regarded as a Pandora with her box opened ; ;
and the disguised one , as the serpent creeping with his deadly wiles into Paradise '' .
Tobacco Road is dead .
Long live Tobacco Road .
Nostalgic Yankee readers of Erskine Caldwell are today informed by proud Georgians that Tobacco Road is buried beneath a four-lane super highway , over which travel each day suburbanite businessmen more concerned with the Dow-Jones average than with the cotton crop .
Thus we are compelled to face the urbanization of the South -- an urbanization which , despite its dramatic and overwhelming effects upon the Southern culture , has been utterly ignored by the bulk of Southern writers .
Indeed , it seems that only in today's Southern fiction does Tobacco Road , with all the traditional trimmings of sowbelly and cornbread and mint juleps , continue to live -- but only as a weary , overexploited phantom .
Those writers known collectively as the `` Southern school '' have received accolades from even those critics least prone to eulogize ; ;
according to many critics , in fact , the South has led the North in literature since the Civil War , both quantitatively and qualitatively .
Such writers as William Faulkner and Robert Penn Warren have led the field of somewhat less important writers in a sort of post-bellum renaissance .
It is interesting , however , that despite this strong upsurge in Southern writing , almost none of the writers has forsaken the firmly entrenched concept of the white-suited big-daddy colonel sipping a mint julep as he silently recounts the revenue from the season's cotton and tobacco crops ; ;
of the stereotyped Negro servants chanting hymns as they plow the fields ; ;
of these and a host of other antiquated legends that deny the South its progressive leaps of the past century .
This is not to say that the South is no longer agrarian ; ;
such a statement would be the rankest form of oversimplification .
But the South is , and has been for the past century , engaged in a wide-sweeping urbanization which , oddly enough , is not reflected in its literature .
In 1900 the South was only 15% urban ; ;
in 1950 it had become 47.1% urban .
In a mere half-century the South has more than tripled its urban status .
There is a New South emerging , a South losing the folksy traditions of an agrarian society with the rapidity of an avalanche -- especially within recent decades .
As the New South snowballs toward further urbanization , it becomes more and more homogeneous with the North -- a tendency which Willard Thorp terms `` Yankeefication '' , as evidenced in such cities as Charlotte , Birmingham , and Houston .
It is said that , even at the present stage of Southern urbanization , such a city as Atlanta is not distinctly unlike Columbus or Trenton .
Undoubtedly even the old Southern stalwart Richmond has felt the new wind : William Styron mentions in his latest novel an avenue named for Bankhead McGruder , a Civil War general , now renamed , in typical California fashion , `` Buena Vista Terrace '' .
The effects of television and other mass media are erasing regional dialects and localisms with a startling force .
As for progress , the `` backward South '' can boast of Baton Rouge , which increased its population between 1940 and 1950 by two hundred and sixty-two percent , to 126,000 , the second largest growth of the period for all cities over 25,000 .
The field , then , is ripe for new Southerners to step to the fore and write of this twentieth-century phenomenon , the Southern Yankeefication : the new urban economy , the city-dweller , the pains of transition , the labor problems ; ;
the list is , obviously , endless .
But these sources have not been tapped .
Truman Capote is still reveling in Southern Gothicism , exaggerating the old Southern legends into something beautiful and grotesque , but as unreal as -- or even more unreal than -- yesterday .
William Styron , while facing the changing economy with a certain uneasy reluctance , insists he is not to be classified as a Southern writer and yet includes traditional Southern concepts in everything he publishes .
Even the great god Faulkner , the South's one probable contender for literary immortality , has little concerned himself with these matters ; ;
such are simply not within his bounded province .
Where are the writers to treat these changes ? ?
Has the agrarian tradition become such an addiction that the switch to urbanism is somehow dreaded or unwanted ? ?
Perhaps present writers hypnotically cling to the older order because they consider it useful and reliable through repeated testings over the decades .
Lacking the pioneer spirit necessary to write of a new economy , these writers seem to be contenting themselves with an old one that is now as defunct as Confederate money .
An example of the changes which have crept over the Southern region may be seen in the Southern Negro's quest for a position in the white-dominated society , a problem that has been reflected in regional fiction especially since 1865 .
Today the Negro must discover his role in an industrialized South , which indicates that the racial aspect of the Southern dilemma hasn't changed radically , but rather has gradually come to be reflected in this new context , this new coat of paint .
The Negro faces as much , if not more , difficulty in fitting himself into an urban economy as he did in an agrarian one .
This represents a gradual change in an ever-present social problem .
But there have been abrupt changes as well : the sit-ins , the picket lines , the bus strikes -- all of these were unheard-of even ten years ago .
Today's evidence , such as the fact that only three Southern states ( South Carolina , Alabama and Mississippi ) still openly defy integration , would have astounded many of yesterday's Southerners into speechlessness .
Other examples of gradual changes that have affected the Negro have been his moving up , row by row , in the buses ; ;
his requesting , and often getting , higher wages , better working conditions , better schools -- changes that were slowly emerging even before the Supreme Court decision of 1954 .
Then came this decision , which sped the process of gaining equality ( or perhaps hindered it ; ;
only historical evolution will determine which ) : an abrupt change .
Since 1954 the Negro's desire for social justice has led to an ironically anarchical rebellion .
He has frequently refused to move from white lunch counters , refused to obey local laws which he considers unjust , while in other cases he has appealed to federal laws .
This bold self-assertion , after decades of humble subservience , is indeed a twentieth-century phenomenon , an abrupt change in the Southern way of existence .
A new order is thrusting itself into being .
A new South is emerging after the post-bellum years of hesitation , uncertainty , and lack of action from the Negro in defining his new role in the amorphously defined socio-political organizations of the white man .
The modern Negro has not made a decisive debut into Southern fiction .
It is clear that , while most writers enjoy picturing the Negro as a woolly-headed , humble old agrarian who mutters `` yassuhs '' and `` sho' nufs '' with blissful deference to his white employer ( or , in Old South terms , `` massuh '' ) , this stereotype is doomed to become in reality as obsolete as Caldwell's Lester .
While there may still be many Faulknerian Lucas Beauchamps scattered through the rural South , such men appear to be a vanishing breed .
Writers openly admit that the Negro is easier to write than the white man ; ;
but they obviously mean by this , not a Negro personality , but a Negro type .
Presenting an individualized Negro character , it would seem , is one of the most difficult assignments a Southern writer could tackle ; ;
and the success of such an endeavor is , as suggested above , glaringly rare .
Just as the Negro situation points up the gradual and abrupt changes affecting Southern life , it also points up the non-representation of urbanism in Southern literature .
The book concerned with the Negro's role in an urban society is rare indeed ; ;
recently only Keith Wheeler's novel , Peaceable Lane , has openly faced the problem .
All but the most rabid of Confederate flag wavers admit that the Old Southern tradition is defunct in actuality and sigh that its passing was accompanied by the disappearance of many genteel and aristocratic traditions of the reputedly languid ante-bellum way of life .
Many earlier writers , mourning the demise of the old order , tended to romanticize and exaggerate this `` gracious Old South '' imagery , creating such lasting impressions as Margaret Mitchell's `` Tara '' Plantation .
Modern writers , who are supposed to keep their fingers firmly upon the pulse of their subjects , insist upon drawing out this legend , prolonging its burial , when it well deserves a rest after the overexploitation of the past century .
Perhaps these writers have been too deeply moved by this romanticizing ; ;
but they can hardly deny that , exaggerated or not , the old panorama is dead .
As John T. Westbrook says in his article , `` Twilight Of Southern Regionalism '' ( Southwest Review , Winter 1957 ) : `` The miasmal mausoleum where an Old South , already too minutely autopsied in prose and poetry , should be left to rest in peace , forever dead and ( let us fervently hope ) forever done with '' .
Westbrook further bemoans the Southern writers' creation of an unreal image of their homeland , which is too readily assimilated by both foreign readers and visiting Yankees : `` Our northerner is suspicious of all this crass evidence ( of urbanization ) presented to his senses .
It bewilders and befuddles him .
He is too deeply steeped in William Faulkner and Robert Penn Warren .
The fumes of progress are in his nose and the bright steel of industry towers before his eyes , but his heart is away in Yoknapatawpha County with razorback hogs and night riders .
On this trip to the South he wants , above all else , to sniff the effluvium of backwoods-and-sand-hill subhumanity and to see at least one barn burn at midnight '' .
Obviously , such a Northern tourist's purpose is somewhat akin to a child's experience with Disneyland : he wants to see a world of make-believe .
In the meantime , while the South has been undergoing this phenomenal modernization that is so disappointing to the curious Yankee , Southern writers have certainly done little to reflect and promote their region's progress .
Willard Thorp , in his new book , American Writing In The Twentieth Century , observes , quite validly it seems : `` Certain subjects are conspicuously absent or have been only lightly touched .
No Southern novelist has done for Atlanta or Birmingham what Herrick , Dreiser , and Farrell did for Chicago or Dos Passos did for New York .
There are almost no fictional treatments of the industrialized south '' .
Not a single Southern author , major or minor , has made the urban problems of an urban South his primary source material .
Faulkner , for one , appears to be safe from the accusing fingers of all assailants in this regard .
Faulkner culminates the Southern legend perhaps more masterfully than it has ever been , or could ever be , done .
He has made it his , and his it remains , irrevocably .
He treats it with a mythological , universal application .
As his disciples boast , even though his emphasis is elsewhere , Faulkner does show his awareness of the changing order of the South quite keenly , as can be proven by a quick recalling of his Sartoris and Snopes families .
Even two decades ago in Go Down , Moses Faulkner was looking to the more urban future with a glimmer of hope that through its youth and its new way of life the South might be reborn and the curse of slavery erased from its soil .
Yet his concern even here is with a slowly changing socio-economic order in general , and he never deals with such specific aspects of this change as the urban and industrial impact .
Faulkner traces , in his vast and overpowering saga of Yoknapatawpha County , the gradual changes which seep into the South , building layer upon layer of minute , subtle innovation which eventually tend largely to hide the Old Way .
Thus Faulkner reminds us , and wisely , that the `` new '' South has gradually evolved out of the Old South , and consequently its agrarian roots persist .
Yet he presents a realm of source material which may well serve other writers if not himself : the problems with which a New South must grapple in groping through a blind adolescence into the maturity of urbanization .
With new mechanization the modern farmer must perform the work of six men : a machine stands between the agrarian and his soil .
The thousands of city migrants who desert the farms yearly must readjust with even greater stress and tension : the sacred wilderness is gradually surrendering to suburbs and research parks and industrial areas .
Another element to concern the choreographer is that of the visual devices of the theatre .
Most avant-garde creators , true to their interest in the self-sufficiency of pure movement , have tended to dress their dancers in simple lines and solid colors ( often black ) and to give them a bare cyclorama for a setting .
But Robert Rauschenberg , the neo-dadaist artist , has collaborated with several of them .
He has designed a matching backdrop and costumes of points of color on white for Mr. Cunningham's Summerspace , so that dancers and background merge into a shimmering unity .
For Mr. Taylor's Images And Reflections she made some diaphanous tents that alternately hide and reveal the performer , and a girl's cape lined with grass .
Mr. Nikolais has made a distinctive contribution to the arts of costume and decor .
In fact , he calls his productions dance-theatre works of motion , shape , light , and sound .
To raise the dancer out of his personal , pedestrian self , Mr. Nikolais has experimented with relating him to a larger , environmental orbit .
He began with masks to make the dancer identify himself with the creature he appeared to be .
He went on to use objects -- hoops , poles , capes -- which he employed as extensions of the body of the dancer , who moved with them .
The depersonalization continued as the dancer was further metamorphosed by the play of lights upon his figure .
In each case , the object , the color , even the percussive sounds of the electronic score were designed to become part of the theatrical being of the performer .
The dancer who never loosens her hold on a parasol , begins to feel that it is part of herself .
Or , clad from head to toe in fabric stretched over a series of hoops , the performer may well lose his sense of self in being a `` finial '' .
As the dancer is depersonalized , his accouterments are animized , and the combined elements give birth to a new being .
From this being come new movement ideas that utilize dancer and property as a single unit .
Thus , the avant-garde choreographers have extended the scope of materials available for dance composition .
But , since they have rejected both narrative and emotional continuity , how are they to unify the impressive array of materials at their disposal ? ?
Some look deliberately to devices used by creators in the other arts and apply corresponding methods to their own work .
Others , less consciously but quite probably influenced by the trends of the times , experiment with approaches that parallel those of the contemporary poet , painter , and musician .
An approach that has appealed to some choreographers is reminiscent of Charles Olson's statement of the process of projective verse : `` one perception must immediately and directly lead to a further perception '' .
The creator trusts his intuition to lead him along a path that has internal validity because it mirrors the reality of his experience .
He disdains external restrictions -- conventional syntax , traditional metre .
The unit of form is determined subjectively : `` the Heart , by the way of the Breath , to the Line '' .
The test of form is fidelity to the experience , a gauge also accepted by the abstract expressionist painters .
An earlier but still influential school of painting , surrealism , had suggested the way of dealing with the dream experience , that event in which seemingly incongruous objects are linked together through the curious associations of the subconscious .
The resulting picture might appear a maze of restless confusions and contradictions , but it is more true to life than a portrait of an artificially contrived order .
The contemporary painter tends to depict not the concrete objects of his experience but their essences as revealed in abstractions of their lines , colors , masses , and energies .
He is still concerned , however , with a personal event .
He accepts the accidents of his brushwork because they provide evidence of the vitality of the experience of creation .
The work must be true to both the physical and the spiritual character of the experience .
Some painters have less interest in the experience of the moment , with its attendant urgencies and ambiguities , than in looking beyond the flux of particular impressions to a higher , more serene level of truth .
Rather than putting their trust in ephemeral sensations they seek form in the stable relationships of pure design , which symbolize an order more real than the disorder of the perceptual world .
The concept remains subjective .
But in this approach it is the artist's ultimate insight , rather than his immediate impressions , that gives form to the work .
Others look to more objective devices of order .
The musician employing the serial technique of composition establishes a mathematical system of rotations that , once set in motion , determines the sequence of pitches and even of rhythms and intensities .
The composer may reverse or invert the order of his original set of intervals ( or rhythms or dynamic changes ) .
He may even alter the pattern by applying a scheme of random numbers .
But he cannot order his elements by will , either rational or inspired .
The system works as an impersonal mechanism .
Musicians who use the chance method also exclude subjective control of formal development .
Again , the composer must select his own materials .
But a tossing of coins , with perhaps the added safeguard of reference to the oracles of the I Ching , the Chinese Book Of Changes , dictates the handling of the chosen materials .
Avant-garde choreographers , seeking new forms of continuity for their new vocabulary of movements , have turned to similar approaches .
Some let dances take their form from the experience of creation .
According to Katherine Litz , `` the becoming , the process of realization , is the dance '' .
The process stipulates that the choreographer sense the quality of the initial movement he has discovered and that he feel the rightness of the quality that is to follow it .
The sequence may involve a sharp contrast : for example , a quiet meditative sway of the body succeeded by a violent leap ; ;
or it may involve more subtle distinctions : the sway may be gradually minimized or enlarged , its rhythmic emphasis may be slightly modified , or it may be transferred to become a movement of only the arms or the head .
Even the least alteration will change the quality .
An exploration of these possible relationships constitutes the process of creation and thereby gives form to the dance .
The approach to the depiction of the experience of creation may be analytic , as it is for Miss Litz , or spontaneous , as it is for Merle Marsicano .
She , too , is concerned with `` the becoming , the process of realization '' , but she does not think in terms of subtle variations of spatial or temporal patterns .
The design is determined emotionally : `` I must reach into myself for the spring that will send me catapulting recklessly into the chaos of event with which the dance confronts me '' .
Looking back , Miss Marsicano feels that her ideas may have been influenced by those of Jackson Pollock .
At one time she felt impelled to make dances that `` moved all over the stage '' , much as Pollock's paintings move violently over the full extent of the canvas .
But her conscious need was to break away from constricting patterns of form , a need to let the experience shape itself .
Midi Garth also believes in subjective continuity that begins with the feeling engendered by an initial movement .
It may be a free front-back swing of the leg , leading to a sideways swing of the arm that develops into a turn and the sensation of taking off from the ground .
This became a dance called Prelude To Flight .
A pervading quality of free lyricism and a building from turns close to the ground towards jumps into the air gives the work its central focus .
Alwin Nikolais objects to art as an outpouring of personal emotion .
He seeks to make his dancers more `` godlike '' by relating them to the impersonal elements of shape , light , color , and sound .
If his dancers are sometimes made to look as if they might be creatures from Mars , this is consistent with his intention of placing them in the orbit of another world , a world in which they are freed of their pedestrian identities .
It is through the metamorphosed dancer that the germ of form is discovered .
In his recognition of his impersonal self the dancer moves , and this self , in the `` first revealed stroke of its existence '' , states the theme from which all else must follow .
The theme may be the formation of a shape from which other shapes evolve .
It may be a reaction to a percussive sound , the following movements constituting further reactions .
It may establish the relation of the figure of the dancer to light and color , in which case changes in the light or color will set off a kaleidescope of visual designs .
Unconcerned with the practical function of his actions , the dancer is engrossed exclusively in their `` motional content '' .
Movements unfold freely because they are uninhibited by emotional bias or purposive drive .
But the metamorphosis must come first .
Though he is also concerned with freeing dance from pedestrian modes of activity , Merce Cunningham has selected a very different method for achieving his aim .
He rejects all subjectively motivated continuity , any line of action related to the concept of cause and effect .
He bases his approach on the belief that anything can follow anything .
An order can be chanced rather than chosen , and this approach produces an experience that is `` free and discovered rather than bound and remembered '' .
Thus , there is freshness not only in the individual movements of the dance but in the shape of their continuity as well .
Chance , he finds , enables him to create `` a world beyond imagination '' .
He cites with pleasure the comment of a lady , who exclaimed after a concert : `` Why , it's extremely interesting .
But I would never have thought of it myself '' .
The sequence of movements in a Cunningham dance is unlike any sequence to be seen in life .
At one side of the stage a dancer jumps excitedly ; ;
nearby , another sits motionless , while still another is twirling an umbrella .
A man and a girl happen to meet ; ;
they look straight at the audience , not at each other .
He lifts her , puts her down , and walks off , neither pleased nor disturbed , as if nothing had happened .
If one dancer slaps another , the victim may do a pirouette , sit down , or offer his assailant a fork and spoon .
Events occur without apparent reason .
Their consequences are irrelevant -- or there are no consequences at all .
The sequence is determined by chance , and Mr. Cunningham makes use of any one of several chance devices .
He may toss coins ; ;
he may take slips of paper from a grab bag .
The answers derived by these means may determine not only the temporal organization of the dance but also its spatial design , special slips designating the location on the stage where the movement is to be performed .
The other variables include the dancer who is to perform the movement and the length of time he is to take in its performance .
The only factors that are personally set by the choreographer are the movements themselves , the number of the dancers , and the approximate total duration of the dance .
The `` approximate '' is important , because even after the order of the work has been established by the chance method , the result is not inviolable .
Each performance may be different .
If a work is divided into several large segments , a last-minute drawing of random numbers may determine the order of the segments for any particular performance .
And any sequence can not only change its positions in the work but can even be eliminated from it altogether .
Mr. Cunningham tries not to cheat the chance method ; ;
he adheres to its dictates as faithfully as he can .
However , there is always the possibility that chance will make demands the dancers find impossible to execute .
Then the choreographer must arbitrate .
He must rearrange matters so that two performers do not bump into each other .
He must construct transitions so that a dancer who is told to lie prone one second and to leap wildly the next will have some physical preparation for the leap .
The North and the South were in greater agreement on sovereignty , through all their dispute about it , than were the Founding Fathers .
The truth in their conflicting concepts was expounded by statesmen of the calibre of Webster and Calhoun , and defended in the end by leaders of the nobility of Lincoln and Lee .
The people everywhere had grown meanwhile in devotion to basic democratic principles , in understanding of and belief in the federal balance , and in love of their Union .
Repeated efforts -- beginning with the Missouri Compromise of 1821 -- were made by such master moderates as Clay and Douglas to resolve the difference peacefully by compromise , rather than clear thought and timely action .
Even so , confusion in this period gained such strength ( from compromise and other factors ) that it led to the bloodiest war of the Nineteenth century .
Nothing can show more than this the immensity of the danger to democratic peoples that lies in even relatively slight deviation from their true concept of sovereignty .
The present issue in Atlantica -- whether to transform an alliance of sovereign nations into a federal union of sovereign citizens -- resembles the American one of 1787-89 rather than the one that was resolved by Civil War .
And so I would only touch upon it now ( much as I have long wanted to write a book about it ) .
I think it is essential , however , to pinpoint here the difference between the two concepts of sovereignty that went to war in 1861 -- if only to see better how imperative is our need today to clarify completely our far worse confusion on this subject .
The difference came down to this : The Southern States insisted that the United States was , in last analysis , what its name implied -- a Union of States .
To their leaders the Constitution was a compact made by the people of sovereign states , who therefore retained the right to secede from it .
This right of the State , its upholders contended , was essential to maintain the federal balance and protect the liberty of the people from the danger of centralizing power in the Union government .
The champions of the Union maintained that the Constitution had formed , fundamentally , the united people of America , that it was a compact among sovereign citizens rather than states , and that therefore the states had no right to secede , though the citizens could .
Writing to Speed on August 24 , 1855 , Lincoln made the latter point clear .
In homely terms whose timeliness is startling today , he thus declared his own right to secede .
``
We began by declaring that all men are created equal .
We now practically read it , all men are created equal except Negroes .
When the Know-nothings get control , it will read , All men are created equal except Negroes and foreigners and Catholics .
When it comes to this , I shall prefer emigrating to some country where they make no pretence of loving liberty -- to Russia , for instance , where despotism can be taken pure , without the base alloy of hypocrisy '' ( His emphasis )
.
When the Southern States exercised their `` right to secede '' , they formed what they officially styled `` The Confederate States of America '' .
Dictionaries , as we have seen , still cite this government , along with the Articles of Confederation of 1781 , as an example of a confederacy .
The fact is that the Southern Confederacy differed from the earlier one almost as much as the Federal Constitution did .
The Confederate Constitution copied much of the Federal Constitution verbatim , and most of the rest in substance .
It operated on , by and for the people individually just as did the Federal Constitution .
It made substantially the same division of power between the central and state governments , and among the executive , legislative and judicial branches .
The difference between confederacy and federal union in 1861
Many believe -- and understandably -- that the great difference between the Constitution of the Southern Confederacy and the Federal Constitution was that the former recognized the right of each state to secede .
But though each of its members had asserted this right against the Union , the final Constitution which the Confederacy signed on March 11 -- nearly a month before hostilities began -- included no explicit provision authorizing a state to secede .
Its drafters discussed this vital point but left it out of their Constitution .
Their President , Jefferson Davis , interpreted their Constitution to mean that it `` admits of no coerced association '' , but this remained so doubtful that `` there were frequent demands that the right to secede be put into the Constitution '' .
The Constitution of the Southern `` Confederation '' differed from that of the Federal Union only in two important respects : It openly , defiantly , recognized slavery -- an institution which the Southerners of 1787 , even though they continued it , found so impossible to reconcile with freedom that they carefully avoided mentioning the word in the Federal Constitution .
They recognized that slavery was a moral issue and not merely an economic interest , and that to recognize it explicitly in their Constitution would be in explosive contradiction to the concept of sovereignty they had set forth in the Declaration of 1776 that `` all men are created equal , that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights , that among them are life , liberty and the pursuit of happiness .
'' The other important difference between the two Constitutions was that the President of the Confederacy held office for six ( instead of four ) years , and was limited to one term .
These are not , however , differences in federal structure .
The only important differences from that standpoint , between the two Constitutions , lies in their Preambles .
The one of 1861 made clear that in making their government the people were acting through their states , whereas the Preamble of 1787-89 expressed , as clearly as language can , the opposite concept , that they were acting directly as citizens .
Here are the two Preambles : Federal Constitution , 1789
`` we the People of the United States , in order to form a more perfect Union , establish Justice , insure domestic Tranquility , provide for the common Defence , promote the general Welfare , and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity , do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America '' .
Confederate Constitution , 1861
`` We the people of the Confederate States , each state acting in its sovereign and independent character , in order to form a permanent federal government , establish justice , insure domestic tranquility , and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity -- invoking the favor and the guidance of Almighty God -- do ordain and establish this Constitution for the Confederate States of America '' .
One is tempted to say that , on the difference between the concepts of sovereignty in these two preambles , the worst war of the Nineteenth century was fought .
But though the Southern States , when drafting a constitution to unite themselves , narrowed the difference to this fine point by omitting to assert the right to secede , the fact remained that by seceding from the Union they had already acted on the concept that it was composed primarily of sovereign states .
If the Union conceded this to them , the same right must be conceded to each remaining state whenever it saw fit to secede : This would destroy the federal balance between it and the states , and in the end sacrifice to the sovereignty of the states all the liberty the citizens had gained by their Union .
Lincoln saw that the act of secession made the issue for the Union a vital one : Whether it was a Union of sovereign citizens that should continue to live , or an association of sovereign states that must fall prey either to `` anarchy or despotism '' .
Much as he abhorred slavery , Lincoln was always willing to concede to each `` slave state '' the right to decide independently whether to continue or end it .
Though his election was interpreted by many Southerners as the forerunner of a dangerous shift in the federal balance in favor of the Union , Lincoln himself proposed no such change in the rights the Constitution gave the states .
After the war began , he long refused to permit emancipation of the slaves by Union action even in the Border States that stayed with the Union .
He issued his Emancipation Proclamation only when he felt that necessity left him no other way to save the Union .
In his Message of December 2 , 1862 , he put his purpose and his policy in these words -- which I would call the Lincoln Law of Liberty-and-Union : `` In giving freedom to the slave , we assure freedom to the free '' .
What Lincoln could not concede was that the states rather than the people were sovereign in the Union .
He fought to the end to preserve it as a `` government of the people , by the people , for the people '' .
The truth on each side won in the civil war
The fact that the Americans who upheld the sovereignty of their states did this in order to keep many of their people more securely in slavery -- the antithesis of individual liberty -- made the conflict grimmer , and the greater .
Out of this ordeal the citizen emerged , in the South as in the North , as America's true sovereign , in `` a new birth of freedom '' , as Lincoln promised .
But before this came about , 214,938 Americans had given their lives in battle for the two concepts of the sovereign rights of men and of states .
On their decisive battlefield Lincoln did not distinguish between them when he paid tribute to the `` brave men , living and dead , who fought here '' .
He understood that both sides were at fault , and he reached the height of saying so explicitly in his Second Inaugural .
To my knowledge , Lincoln remains the only Head of State and Commander-in-Chief who , while fighting a fearful war whose issue was in doubt , proved man enough to say this publicly -- to give his foe the benefit of the fact that in all human truth there is some error , and in all our error , some truth .
So great a man could not but understand , too , that the thing that moves men to sacrifice their lives is not the error of their thought , which their opponents see and attack , but the truth which the latter do not see -- any more than they see the error which mars the truth they themselves defend .
It is much less difficult now than in Lincoln's day to see that on both sides sovereign Americans had given their lives in the Civil War to maintain the balance between the powers they had delegated to the States and to their Union .
They differed in the balance they believed essential to the sovereignty of the citizen -- but the supreme sacrifice each made served to maintain a still more fundamental truth : That individual life , liberty and happiness depend on a right balance between the two -- and on the limitation of sovereignty , in all its aspects , which this involves .
The 140,414 Americans who gave `` the last full measure of devotion '' to prevent disunion , preserved individual freedom in the United States from the dangers of anarchy , inherent in confederations , which throughout history have proved fatal in the end to all associations composed primarily of sovereign states , and to the liberties of their people .
But the fact that 70,524 other Americans gave the same measure of devotion to an opposing concept served Liberty-and-Union in other essential ways .
Its appeal from ballots to bullets at Fort Sumter ended by costing the Southerners their right to have slaves -- a right that was even less compatible with the sovereignty of man .
The very fact that they came so near to winning by the wrong method , war , led directly to their losing both the war and the wrong thing they fought for , since it forced Lincoln to free their slaves as a military measure .
There was a divine justice in one wrong thus undoing another .
There was also a lesson , one that has served ever since to keep Americans , in their conflicts with one another , from turning from the ballot to the bullet .
Yet though the Southern States lost the worst errors in their case , they did not lose the truth they fought for .
The lives so many of them gave , to forestall what they believed would be a fatal encroachment by the Union on the powers reserved to their states have continued ever since to safeguard all Americans against freedom's other foe .
As cells coalesced into organisms , they built new `` unnatural '' and internally controlled environments to cope even more successfully with the entropy-increasing properties of the external world .
The useful suggestion of Professor David Hawkins which considers culture as a third stage in biological evolution fits quite beautifully then with our suggestion that science has provided us with a rather successful technique for building protective artificial environments .
One wonders about its applicability to people .
Will advances in human sciences help us build social structures and governments which will enable us to cope with people as effectively as the primitive combination of protein and nucleic acid built a structure of molecules which enabled it to adapt to a sea of molecular interaction ? ?
The answer is , of course , yes .
For the family is the simplest example of just such a unit , composed of people , which gives us both some immunity from , and a way of dealing with , other people .
Social invention did not have to await social theory any more than use of the warmth of a fire had to await Lavoisier or the buoyant protection of a boat the formulations of Archimedes .
But it has been during the last two centuries , during the scientific revolution , that our independence from the physical environment has made the most rapid strides .
We have ample light when the sun sets ; ;
the temperature of our homes is independent of the seasons ; ;
we fly through the air , although gravity pulls us down ; ;
the range of our voice ignores distance .
At what stage are social sciences then ? ?
Is the future of psychology akin to the rich future of physics at the time of Newton ? ?
There is a haunting resemblance between the notion of cause in Copernicus and in Freud .
And it is certainly no slight to either of them to compare both their achievements and their impact .
Political theoretical understanding , although almost at a standstill during this century , did develop during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries , and resulted in a flood of inventions which increased the possibility for man to coexist with man .
Consitutional government , popular vote , trial by jury , public education , labor unions , cooperatives , communes , socialized ownership , world courts , and the veto power in world councils are but a few examples .
Most of these , with horrible exceptions , were conceived as is a ship , not as an attempt to quell the ocean of mankind , nor to deny its force , but as a means to survive and enjoy it .
The most effective political inventions seem to make maximum use of natural harbors and are aware that restraining breakwaters can play only a minor part in the whole scheme .
Just as present technology had to await the explanations of physics , so one might expect that social invention will follow growing sociological understanding .
We are desperately in the need of such invention , for man is still very much at the mercy of man .
In fact the accumulation of the hardware of destruction is day by day increasing our fear of each other .
3 ,
I want , therefore , to discuss a second and quite different fruit of science , the connection between scientific understanding and fear .
There are certainly large areas of understanding in the human sciences which in themselves and even without political invention can help to dispel our present fears .
Lucretius has remarked : `` The reason why all Mortals are so gripped by fear is that they see all sorts of things happening in the earth and sky with no discernable cause , and these they attribute to the will of God '' .
Perhaps things were even worse then .
It is difficult to reconstruct the primeval fears of man .
We get some clue from a few remembrances of childhood and from the circumstance that we are probably not much more afraid of people now than man ever was .
We are not now afraid of atomic bombs in the same way that people once feared comets .
The bombs are as harmless as an automobile in a garage .
We are worried about what people may do with them -- that some crazy fool may `` push the button '' .
I am certainly not adequately trained to describe or enlarge on human fears , but there are certain features of the fears dispelled by scientific explanations that stand out quite clearly .
They are in general those fears that once seemed to have been amenable to prayer or ritual .
They include both individual fears and collective ones .
They arise in situations in which one believes that what happens depends not only on the external world , but also on the precise pattern of behavior of the individual or group .
Often it is recognized that all the details of the pattern may not be essential to the outcome but , because the pattern was empirically determined and not developed through theoretical understanding , one is never quite certain which behavior elements are effective , and the whole pattern becomes ritualized .
Yet often fear persists because , even with the most rigid ritual , one is never quite free from the uneasy feeling that one might make some mistake or that in every previous execution one had been unaware of the really decisive act .
To say that science had reduced many such fears merely reiterates the obvious and frequent statement that science eliminated much of magic and superstition .
But a somewhat more detailed analysis of this process may be illuminating .
The frequently postulated antique worry that the daylight hours might dwindle to complete darkness apparently gave rise to a ritual and celebration which we still recognize .
It is curious that even centuries of repetition of the yearly cycle did not induce a sufficient degree of confidence to allow people to abandon the ceremonies of the winter solstice .
This and other fears of the solar system have disappeared gradually , first , with the Ptolemaic system and its built-in concept of periodicity and then , more firmly , with the Newtonian innovation of an universal force that could account quantitatively for both terrestial and celestial motions .
This understanding provides a very simple example of the fact that one can eliminate fear without instituting any controls .
In fact , although we have dispelled the fear , we have not necessarily assured ourselves that there are no dangers .
There is still the remote possibility of planetoid collision .
A meteor could fall on San Francisco .
Solar activities could presumably bring long periods of flood or drought .
Our understanding of the solar system has taught us to replace our former elaborate rituals with the appropriate action which , in this case , amounts to doing nothing .
Yet we no longer feel uneasy .
This almost trivial example is nevertheless suggestive , for there are some elements in common between the antique fear that the days would get shorter and shorter and our present fear of war .
We , in our country , think of war as an external threat which , if it occurs , will not be primarily of our own doing .
And yet we obviously also believe that the avoidance of the disaster depends in some obscure or at least uncertain way on the details of how we behave .
What elements of our behavior are decisive ? ?
Our weapons production , our world prestige , our ideas of democracy , our actions of trust or stubbornness or secrecy or espionage ? ?
We have staved off a war and , since our behavior has involved all these elements , we can only keep adding to our ritual without daring to abandon any part of it , since we have not the slightest notion which parts are effective .
I think that we are here also talking of the kind of fear that a young boy has for a group of boys who are approaching at night along the streets of a large city .
If an automobile were approaching him , he would know what was required of him , even though he might not be able to act quickly enough .
With the group of boys it is different .
He does not know whether to look up or look aside , to put his hands in his pockets or to clench them at his side , to cross the street , or to continue on the same side .
When confronted with a drunk or an insane person I have no notion of what any one of them might do to me or to himself or to others .
I believe that what I do has some effect on his actions and I have learned , in a way , to commune with drunks , but certainly my actions seem to resemble more nearly the performance of a rain dance than the carrying out of an experiment in physics .
I am usually filled with an uneasiness that through some unwitting slip all hell may break loose .
Our inability to explain why certain people are fond of us frequently induces the same kind of ritual and malaise .
We are forced , in our behavior towards others , to adopt empirically successful patterns in toto because we have such a minimal understanding of their essential elements .
Our collective policies , group and national , are similarly based on voodoo , but here we often lack even the empirically successful rituals and are still engaged in determing them .
We use terms from our personal experience with individuals such as `` trust '' , `` cheat '' , and `` get tough '' .
We talk about national character in the same way that Copernicus talked of the compulsions of celestial bodies to move in circles .
We perform elaborate international exhortations and ceremonies with virtually no understanding of social cause and effect .
Small wonder , then , that we fear .
The achievements which dispelled our fears of the cosmos took place three centuries ago .
What additional roles has the scientific understanding of the 19th and 20th centuries played ? ?
In the physical sciences , these achievements concern electricity , chemistry , and atomic physics .
In the life sciences , there has been an enormous increase in our understanding of disease , in the mechanisms of heredity , and in bio- and physiological chemistry .
The major effect of these advances appears to lie in the part they have played in the industrial revolution and in the tools which scientific understanding has given us to build and manipulate a more protective environment .
In addition , our way of dealing directly with natural phenomena has also changed .
Even in domains where detailed and predictive understanding is still lacking , but where some explanations are possible , as with lightning and weather and earthquakes , the appropriate kind of human action has been more adequately indicated .
Apparently the population as a whole eventually acquires enough confidence in the explanations of the scientists to modify its procedures and its fears .
How and why this process occurs would provide an interesting separate subject for study .
In some areas , the progress is slower than in others .
In agriculture , for example , despite the advances in biology , elaborate rituals tend to persist along with a continued sense of the imminence of some natural disaster .
In child care , the opposite extreme prevails ; ;
procedures change rapidly and parental confidence probably exceeds anything warranted by established psychological theory .
There are many domains in which understanding has brought about widespread and quite appropriate reduction in ritual and fear .
Much of the former extreme uneasiness associated with visions and hallucinations and with death has disappeared .
The persistent horror of having a malformed child has , I believe , been reduced , not because we have gained any control over this misfortune , but precisely because we have learned that we have so little control over it .
In fact , the recent warnings about the use of X-rays have introduced fears and ambiguities of action which now require more detailed understanding , and thus in this instance , science has momentarily aggravated our fears .
In fact , insofar as science generates any fear , it stems not so much from scientific prowess and gadgets but from the fact that new unanswered questions arise , which , until they are understood , create uncertainty .
Perhaps the most illuminating example of the reduction of fear through understanding is derived from our increased knowledge of the nature of disease .
The situation with regard to our attitude and `` control '' of disease contains close analogies to problems confronting us with respect to people .
The fear of disease was formerly very much the kind of fear I have tried to describe .
Nothing like Godot , he arrived before the hour .
His letter had suggested we meet at my hotel at noon on Sunday , and I came into the lobby as the clock struck twelve .
He was waiting .
My wish to meet Samuel Beckett had been prompted by simple curiosity and interest in his work .
American newspaper reviewers like to call his plays nihilistic .
They find deep pessimism in them .
Even so astute a commentator as Harold Clurman of The Nation has said that `` Waiting For Godot '' is `` the concentrate of the contemporary European mood of despair '' .
But to me Beckett's writing had seemed permeated with love for human beings and with a kind of humor that I could reconcile neither with despair nor with nihilism .
Could it be that my own eyes and ears had deceived me ? ?
Is his a literature of defeat , irrelevant to the social crises we face ? ?
Or is it relevant because it teaches us something useful to know about ourselves ? ?
I knew that a conversation with the author would not settle such questions , because a man is not the same as his writing : in the last analysis , the questions had to be settled by the work itself .
Nevertheless I was curious .
My curiosity was sharpened a day or two before the interview by a conversation I had with a well-informed teacher of literature , a Jesuit father , at a conference on religious drama near Paris .
When Beckett's name came into the discussion , the priest grew loud and told me that Beckett `` hates life '' .
That , I thought , is at least one thing I can find out when we meet .
Beckett's appearance is rough-hewn Irish .
The features of his face are distinct , but not fine .
They look as if they had been sculptured with an unsharpened chisel .
Unruly hair goes straight up from his forehead , standing so high that the top falls gently over , as if to show that it really is hair and not bristle .
One might say it combines the man ; ;
own pride and humility .
For he has the pride that comes of self-acceptance and the humility , perhaps of the same genesis , not to impose himself upon another .
His light blue eyes , set deep within the face , are actively and continually looking .
He seems , by some unconscious division of labor , to have given them that one function and no other , leaving communication to the rest of the face .
The mouth frequently breaks into a disarming smile .
The voice is light in timbre , with a rough edge that corresponds to his visage .
The Irish accent is , as one would expect , combined with slight inflections from the French .
His tweed suit was a baggy gray and green .
He wore a brown knit sports shirt with no tie .
We walked down the Rue De L'Arcade , thence along beside the Madeleine and across to a sidewalk cafe opposite that church .
The conversation that ensued may have been engrossing but it could hardly be called world-shattering .
For one thing , the world that Beckett sees is already shattered .
His talk turns to what he calls `` the mess '' , or sometimes `` this buzzing confusion '' .
I reconstruct his sentences from notes made immediately after our conversation .
What appears here is shorter than what he actually said but very close to his own words .
`` The confusion is not my invention .
We cannot listen to a conversation for five minutes without being acutely aware of the confusion .
It is all around us and our only chance now is to let it in .
The only chance of renovation is to open our eyes and see the mess .
It is not a mess you can make sense of '' .
I suggested that one must let it in because it is the truth , but Beckett did not take to the word truth .
`` What is more true than anything else ? ?
To swim is true , and to sink is true .
One is not more true than the other .
One cannot speak anymore of being , one must speak only of the mess .
When Heidegger and Sartre speak of a contrast between being and existence , they may be right , I don't know , but their language is too philosophical for me .
I am not a philosopher .
One can only speak of what is in front of him , and that now is simply the mess '' .
Then he began to speak about the tension in art between the mess and form .
Until recently , art has withstood the pressure of chaotic things .
It has held them at bay .
It realized that to admit them was to jeopardize form .
`` How could the mess be admitted , because it appears to be the very opposite of form and therefore destructive of the very thing that art holds itself to be '' ? ?
But now we can keep it out no longer , because we have come into a time when `` it invades our experience at every moment .
It is there and it must be allowed in '' .
I granted this might be so , but found the result to be even more attention to form than was the case previously .
And why not ? ?
How , I asked , could chaos be admitted to chaos ? ?
Would not that be the end of thinking and the end of art ? ?
If we look at recent art we find it preoccupied with form .
Beckett's own work is an example .
Plays more highly formalized than `` Waiting For Godot '' , `` Endgame '' , and `` Krapp's Last Tape '' would be hard to find .
`` What I am saying does not mean that there will henceforth be no form in art .
It only means that there will be new form , and that this form will be of such a type that it admits the chaos and does not try to say that the chaos is really something else .
The form and the chaos remain separate .
The latter is not reduced to the former .
That is why the form itself becomes a preoccupation , because it exists as a problem separate from the material it accommodates .
To find a form that accommodates the mess , that is the task of the artist now '' .
Yet , I responded , could not similar things be said about the art of the past ? ?
Is it not characteristic of the greatest art that it confronts us with something we cannot clarify , demanding that the viewer respond to it in his own never-predictable way ? ?
What is the history of criticism but the history of men attempting to make sense of the manifold elements in art that will not allow themselves to be reduced to a single philosophy or a single aesthetic theory ? ?
Isn't all art ambiguous ? ?
`` Not this '' , he said , and gestured toward the Madeleine .
The classical lines of the church which Napoleon thought of as a Temple of Glory , dominated all the scene where we sat .
The Boulevard De La Madeleine , the Boulevard Malesherbes , and the Rue Royale ran to it with graceful flattery , bearing tidings of the Age of Reason .
`` Not this .
This is clear .
This does not allow the mystery to invade us .
With classical art , all is settled .
But it is different at Chartres .
There is the unexplainable , and there art raises questions that it does not attempt to answer '' .
I asked about the battle between life and death in his plays .
Didi and Gogo hover on the edge of suicide ; ;
Hamm's world is death and Clov may or may not get out of it to join the living child outside .
Is this life-death question a part of the chaos ? ?
`` Yes .
If life and death did not both present themselves to us , there would be no inscrutability .
If there were only darkness , all would be clear .
It is because there is not only darkness but also light that our situation becomes inexplicable .
Take Augustine's doctrine of grace given and grace withheld : have you pondered the dramatic qualities in this theology ? ?
Two thieves are crucified with Christ , one saved and the other damned .
How can we make sense of this division ? ?
In classical drama , such problems do not arise .
The destiny of Racine's Phedre is sealed from the beginning : she will proceed into the dark .
As she goes , she herself will be illuminated .
At the beginning of the play she has partial illumination and at the end she has complete illumination , but there has been no question but that she moves toward the dark .
That is the play .
Within this notion clarity is possible , but for us who are neither Greek nor Jansenist there is not such clarity .
The question would also be removed if we believed in the contrary -- total salvation .
But where we have both dark and light we have also the inexplicable .
The key word in my plays is ' perhaps ' '' .
Given a theological lead , I asked what he thinks about those who find a religious significance to his plays .
`` Well , really there is none at all .
I have no religious feeling .
Once I had a religious emotion .
It was at my first Communion .
No more .
My mother was deeply religious .
So was my brother .
He knelt down at his bed as long as he could kneel .
My father had none .
The family was Protestant , but for me it was only irksome and I let it go .
My brother and mother got no value from their religion when they died .
At the moment of crisis it had no more depth than an old school tie .
Irish Catholicism is not attractive , but it is deeper .
When you pass a church on an Irish bus , all the hands flurry in the sign of the cross .
One day the dogs of Ireland will do that too and perhaps also the pigs '' .
But do the plays deal with the same facets of experience religion must also deal with ? ?
`` Yes , for they deal with distress .
Some people object to this in my writing .
At a party an English intellectual -- so-called -- asked me why I write always about distress .
As if it were perverse to do so ! !
He wanted to know if my father had beaten me or my mother had run away from home to give me an unhappy childhood .
I told him no , that I had had a very happy childhood .
Then he thought me more perverse than ever .
I left the party as soon as possible and got into a taxi .
On the glass partition between me and the driver were three signs : one asked for help for the blind , another help for orphans , and the third for relief for the war refugees .
One does not have to look for distress .
It is screaming at you even in the taxis of London '' .
Lunch was over , and we walked back to the hotel with the light and dark of Paris screaming at us .
The personal quality of Samuel Beckett is similar to qualities I had found in the plays .
He says nothing that compresses experience within a closed pattern .
`` Perhaps '' stands in place of commitment .
At the same time , he is plainly sympathetic , clearly friendly .
If there were only the mess , all would be clear ; ;
but there is also compassion .
As a Christian , I know I do not stand where Beckett stands , but I do see much of what he sees .
As a writer on the theater , I have paid close attention to the plays .
Harold Clurman is right to say that `` Waiting For Godot '' is a reflection ( he calls it a distorted reflection ) `` of the impasse and disarray of Europe's present politics , ethic , and common way of life '' .
Yet it is not only Europe the play refers to .
`` Waiting For Godot '' sells even better in America than in France .
The consciousness it mirrors may have come earlier to Europe than to America , but it is the consciousness that most `` mature '' societies arrive at when their successes in technological and economic systematization propel them into a time of examining the not-strictly-practical ends of culture .
America is now joining Europe in this `` mature '' phase of development .
Whether any of us remain in it long will depend on what happens as a result of the technological and economic revolutions now going on in the countries of Asia and Africa , and also of course on how long the cold war remains cold .
Even Hemingway , for all his efforts to formulate a naturalistic morality in The Sun Also Rises and A Farewell To Arms never maintained that sex was all .
Hemingway's fiction is supported by a `` moral '' backbone and in its search for ultimate meaning hints at a religious dimension .
And D. H. Lawrence , in Fantasia Of The Unconscious , protested vehemently against the overestimation of the sexual motive .
Though sex in some form or other enters into all human activity and it was a good thing that Freud emphasized this aspect of human nature , it is fantastic to explain everything in terms of sex .
`` All is not sex '' , declared Lawrence .
Man is not confined to one outlet for his vital energy .
The creative urge , for example , transcends the body and the self .
But for the beat generation all is sex .
Nothing is more revealing of the way of life and literary aspirations of this group than their attitude toward sex .
For the beatnik , like the hipster , is in opposition to a society that is based on the repression of the sex instinct .
He has elevated sex -- not Eros or libido but pure , spontaneous , uninhibited sex -- to the rank of the godhead ; ;
it is Astarte , Ishtar , Venus , Yahwe , Dionysus , Christ , the mysterious and divine orgone energy flowing through the body of the universe .
Jazz is sex , marijuana is a stimulus to sex , the beat tempo is adjusted to the orgiastic release of the sexual impulse .
Lawrence Lipton , in The Holy Barbarians , stresses that for the beat generation sex is more than a source of pleasure ; ;
it is a mystique , and their private language is rich in the multivalent ambiguities of sexual reference so that they dwell in a sexualized universe of discourse .
The singular uncompromising force of their revolt against the cult of restraint is illustrated by their refusal to dance in a public place .
The dance is but a disguised ritual for the expression of ungratified sexual desire .
For this reason , too , their language is more forthright and earthy .
The beatniks crave a sexual experience in which their whole being participates .
It is therefore not surprising that they resist the lure of marriage and the trap of domesticity , for like cats they are determined not to tame their sexual energy .
They withdraw to the underground of the slums where they can defy the precepts of legalized propriety .
Unlike the heroes and flappers of the lost generation , they disdain the art of `` necking '' and `` petting '' .
That is reserved for the squares .
If they avoid the use of the pungent , outlawed four-letter word it is because it is taboo ; ;
it is sacred .
As Lipton , the prophet of the beat generation , declares : `` In the sexual act , the beat are filled with mana , the divine power .
This is far from the vulgar , leering sexuality of the middle-class square in heat '' .
This is the Holy Grail these knights of the orgasm pursue , this is the irresistible cosmic urge to which they respond .
If Wilhelm Reich is the Moses who has led them out of the Egypt of sexual slavery , Dylan Thomas is the poet who offers them the Dionysian dialectic of justification for their indulgence in liquor , marijuana , sex , and jazz .
In addition , they have been converted to Zen Buddhism , with its glorification of all that is `` natural '' and mysteriously alive , the sense that everything in the world is flowing .
Thus , paradoxically , the beat writers resort to `` religious '' metaphors : they are in search of mana , the spiritual , the numinous , but not anything connected with formal religion .
What they are after is the beatific vision .
And Zen Buddhism , though it is extremely difficult to understand how these internal contradictions are reconciled , helps them in their struggle to achieve personal salvation through sexual release .
The style of life chosen by the beat generation , the rhythm and ritual they have adopted as uniquely their own , is designed to enhance the value of the sexual experience .
Jazz is good not only because it promotes wholeness but because of its decided sexual effect .
Jazz is the musical language of sex , the vocabulary of the orgasm ; ;
indeed , it is maintained that the sexual element in jazz , by freeing the listener of his inhibitions , can have therapeutic value .
That is why , the argument runs , the squares are so fearful of jazz and yet perversely fascinated by it .
Instead of giving themselves spontaneously to the orgiastic release that jazz can give them , they undergo psychoanalysis or flirt with mysticism or turn to prostitutes for satisfaction .
Thus jazz is transmuted into something holy , the sacred road to integration of being .
Jazz , like sex , is a mystique .
It is not a substitute for sex but a dynamic expression of the creative impulse in unfettered man .
The mystique of sex , combined with marijuana and jazz , is intended to provide a design for living .
Those who are sexually liberated can become creatively alive and free , their instincts put at the service of the imagination .
Righteous in their denunciation of all that makes for death , the beat prophets bid all men become cool cats ; ;
let them learn to `` swing '' freely , to let go , to become authentically themselves , and then perhaps civilization will be saved .
The beatnik , seceding from a society that is fatally afflicted with a deathward drive , is concerned with his personal salvation in the living present .
If he is the child of nothingness , if he is the predestined victim of an age of atomic wars , then he will consult only his own organic needs and go beyond good and evil .
He will not curb his instinctual desires but release the energy within him that makes him feel truly and fully alive , even if it is only for this brief moment before the apocalypse of annihilation explodes on earth .
That is why the members of the beat generation proudly assume the title of the holy barbarians ; ;
they will destroy the shrines , temples , museums , and churches of the state that is the implacable enemy of the life they believe in .
Apart from the categorical imperative they derive from the metaphysics of the orgasm , the only affirmation they are capable of making is that art is their only refuge .
Their writing , born of their experiments in marijuana and untrammeled sexuality , reflects the extremity of their existential alienation .
The mind has betrayed them , reason is the foe of life ; ;
they will trust only their physical sensations , the wisdom of the body , the holy promptings of the unconscious .
With lyrical intensity they reveal what they hate , but their faith in love , inspired by the revolutionary rhythms of jazz , culminates in the climax of the orgasm .
Their work mirrors the mentality of the psychopath , rootless and irresponsible .
Their rebellion against authoritarian society is not far removed from the violence of revolt characteristic of the juvenile delinquent .
And the life they lead is undisciplined and for the most part unproductive , even though they make a fetish of devoting themselves to some creative pursuit -- writing , painting , music .
They are non-conformists on principle .
When they express themselves it is incandescent hatred that shines forth , the rage of repudiation , the ecstasy of negation .
It is sex that obsesses them , sex that is at the basis of their aesthetic creed .
What they discuss with dialectical seriousness is the degree to which sex can inspire the Muse .
Monogamy is the vice from which the abjectly fearful middle class continue to suffer , whereas the beatnik has the courage to break out of that prison of respectability .
One girl describes her past , her succession of broken marriages , the abortions she has had and finally confesses that she loves sex and sees no reason why she must justify her passion .
If it is an honest feeling , then why should she not yield to it ? ?
`` Most often '' , she says , `` it's the monogamous relationship that is dishonest '' .
There is nothing holy in wedlock .
This girl soon drops the bourgeois pyschiatrist who disapproves of her life .
She finds married life stifling and every prolonged sex relationship unbearably monotonous .
This confession serves to make clear in part what is behind this sexual revolution : the craving for sensation for its own sake , the need for change , for new experiences .
Boredom is death .
In the realm of physical sensations , sex reigns supreme .
Hence the beatniks sustain themselves on marijuana , jazz , free swinging poetry , exhausting themselves in orgies of sex ; ;
some of them are driven over the borderline of sanity and lose contact with reality .
One beat poet composes a poem , `` Lines On A Tijuana John '' , which contains a few happy hints for survival .
The new fact the initiates of this cult have to learn is that they must move toward simplicity .
The professed mission of this disaffiliated generation is to find a new way of life which they can express in poetry and fiction , but what they produce is unfortunately disordered , nourished solely on the hysteria of negation .
Who are the creative representatives of this movement ? ?
Nymphomaniacs , junkies , homosexuals , drug addicts , lesbians , alcoholics , the weak , the frustrated , the irresolute , the despairing , the derelicts and outcasts of society .
They embrace independent poverty , usually with a `` shack-up '' partner who will help support them .
They are full of contempt for the institution of matrimony .
Their previous legalized marriages do not count , for they hold the laws of the state null and void .
They feel they are leagued against a hostile , persecutory world , faced with the concerted malevolent opposition of squares and their hirelings , the police .
This is the rhetoric of righteousness the beatniks use in defending their way of life , their search for wholeness , though their actual existence fails to reach these `` religious '' heights .
One beatnik got the woman he was living with so involved in drugs and self-analysis and all-night sessions of sex that she was beginning to crack up .
What obsessions had she picked up during these long nights of talk ? ?
Sex as the creative principle of the universe , the secret of primitive religion , the life of myth .
Everything in the final analysis reduced itself to sexual symbolism .
In his chapter on `` The Loveways Of The Beat Generation '' , Lipton spares the reader none of the sordid details .
No one asks questions about the free union of the sexes in West Venice so long as the partners share the negative attitudes of the group .
The women who come to West Venice , having forsaken radicalism , are interested in living only for the moment , in being constantly on the move .
Others who are attracted to this Mecca of the beat generation are homosexuals , heroin addicts , and smalltime hoodlums .
Those who are sexual deviants are naturally drawn to join the beatniks .
Since the homosexuals widely use marijuana , they do not have to be initiated .
Part of the ritual of sex is the use of marijuana .
As Lipton puts it : `` The Eros is felt in the magic circle of marijuana with far greater force , as a unifying principle in human relationships , than at any other time except , perhaps , in the mutual metaphysical orgasms .
The magic circle is , in fact , a symbol of and preparation for the metaphysical orgasm '' .
Under the influence of marijuana the beatnik comes alive within and experiences a wonderfully enhanced sense of self as if he had discovered the open sesame to the universe of being .
Carried high on this `` charge '' , he composes `` magical '' poetry that captures the organic rhythms of life in words .
If he thus achieves a lyrical , dreamlike , drugged intensity , he pays the price for his indulgence by producing work -- Allen Ginsberg's `` Howl '' is a striking example of this tendency -- that is disoriented , Dionysian but without depth and without Apollonian control .
For drugs are in themselves no royal road to creativity .
How is the beat poet to achieve unity of form when he is at the same time engaged in a systematic derangement of senses .
If love reflects the nature of man , as Ortega Y Gasset believes , if the person in love betrays decisively what he is by his behavior in love , then the writers of the beat generation are creating a new literary genre .
There were fences in the old days when we were children .
Across the front of a yard and down the side , they were iron , either spiked along the top or arched in half circles .
Alley fences were made of solid boards higher than one's head , but not so high as the golden glow in a corner or the hollyhocks that grew in a line against them .
Side fences were hidden beneath lilacs and hundred-leaf roses ; ;
front fences were covered with Virginia creeper or trumpet vines or honeysuckle .
Square corner- and gate posts were an open-work pattern of cast-iron foliage ; ;
they were topped by steeples complete in every detail : high-pitched roof , pinnacle , and narrow gable .
On these posts the gates swung open with a squeak and shut with a metallic clang .
The only extended view possible to anyone less tall than the fences was that obtained from an upper bough of the apple tree .
The primary quality of that view seems , now , to have been its quietness , but that cannot at the time have impressed us .
What one actually remembers is its greenness .
From high in the tree , the whole block lay within range of the eye , but the ground was almost nowhere visible .
One looked down on a sea of leaves , a breaking wave of flower .
Every path from back door to barn was covered by a grape-arbor , and every yard had its fruit trees .
In the center of any open space remaining our grandfathers had planted syringa and sweet-shrub , snowball , rose-of-Sharon and balm-of-Gilead .
From above one could only occasionally catch a glimpse of life on the floor of this green sea : a neighbor's gingham skirt flashing into sight for an instant on the path beneath her grape-arbor , or the movement of hands above a clothesline and the flutter of garments hung there , half-way down the block .
That was one epoch : the apple-tree epoch .
Another had ended before it began .
Time is a queer thing and memory a queerer ; ;
the tricks that time plays with memory and memory with time are queerest of all .
From maturity one looks back at the succession of years , counts them and makes them many , yet cannot feel length in the number , however large .
In a stream that turns a mill-wheel there is a lot of water ; ;
the mill-pond is quiet , its surface dark and shadowed , and there does not seem to be much water in it .
Time in the sum is nothing .
And yet -- a year to a child is an eternity , and in the memory that phase of one's being -- a certain mental landscape -- will seem to have endured without beginning and without end .
The part of the mind that preserves dates and events may remonstrate , `` It could have been like that for only a little while '' ; ;
but true memory does not count nor add : it holds fast to things that were and they are outside of time .
Once , then -- for how many years or how few does not matter -- my world was bound round by fences , when I was too small to reach the apple tree bough , to twist my knee over it and pull myself up .
That world was in scale with my own smallness .
I have no picture in my mind of the garden as a whole -- that I could not see -- but certain aspects of certain corners linger in the memory : wind-blown , frost-bitten , white chrysanthemums beneath a window , with their brittle brown leaves and their sharp scent of November ; ;
ripe pears lying in long grass , to be turned over by a dusty-slippered foot , cautiously , lest bees still worked in the ragged , brown-edged holes ; ;
hot-colored verbenas in the corner between the dining-room wall and the side porch , where we passed on our way to the pump with the half-gourd tied to it as a cup by my grandmother for our childish pleasure in drinking from it .
It was mother who planted the verbenas .
I think that my grandmother was not an impassioned gardener : she was too indulgent a lover of dogs and grandchildren .
My great-grandmother , I have been told , made her garden her great pride ; ;
she cherished rare and delicate plants like oleanders in tubs and wall-flowers and lemon verbenas in pots that had to be wintered in the cellar ; ;
she filled the waste spots of the yard with common things like the garden heliotrope in a corner by the woodshed , and the plantain lilies along the west side of the house .
These my grandmother left in their places ( they are still there , more persistent and longer-lived than the generations of man ) and planted others like them , that flourished without careful tending .
Three of these only were protected from us by stern commandment : the roses , whose petals might not be collected until they had fallen , to be made into perfume or rose-tea to drink ; ;
the peonies , whose tight sticky buds would be blighted by the laying on of a finger , although they were not apparently harmed by the ants that crawled over them ; ;
and the poppies .
I have more than once sat cross-legged in the grass through a long summer morning and watched without touching while a poppy bud higher than my head slowly but visibly pushed off its cap , unfolded , and shook out like a banner in the sun its flaming vermilion petals .
Other flowers we might gather as we pleased : myrtle and white violets from beneath the lilacs ; ;
the lilacs themselves , that bloomed so prodigally but for the most part beyond our reach ; ;
snowballs ; ;
hollyhock blossoms that , turned upside down , make pink-petticoated ladies ; ;
and the little , dark blue larkspur that scattered its seed everywhere .
More potent a charm to bring back that time of life than this record of a few pictures and a few remembered facts would be a catalogue of the minutiae which are of the very stuff of the mind , intrinsic , because they were known in the beginning not by the eye alone but by the hand that held them .
Flowers , stones , and small creatures , living and dead .
Pale yellow snapdragons that by pinching could be made to bite ; ;
seed-pods of the balsams that snapped like fire-crackers at a touch ; ;
red-and-yellow columbines whose round-tipped spurs were picked off and eaten for the honey in them ; ;
morning-glory buds which could be so grasped and squeezed that they burst like a blown-up paper bag ; ;
bright flowers from the trumpet vine that made `` gloves '' on the ends of ten waggling fingers .
Fuzzy caterpillars , snails with their sensitive horns , struggling grasshoppers held by their long hind legs and commanded to `` spit tobacco , spit '' .
Dead fledgling birds , their squashed-looking nakedness and the odor of decay that clung to the hand when they had been buried in our graveyard in front of the purple flags .
And the cast shell of a locust , straw-colored and transparent , weighing nothing , fragile but entire , with eyes like bubbles and a gaping slit down its back .
Every morning early , in the summer , we searched the trunks of the trees as high as we could reach for the locust shells , carefully detached their hooked claws from the bark where they hung , and stabled them , a weird faery herd , in an angle between the high roots of the tulip tree , where no grass grew in the dense shade .
We collected `` lucky stones '' -- all the creamy translucent pebbles , worn smooth and round , that we could find in the driveway .
When these had been pocketed , we could still spend a morning cracking open other pebbles for our delight in seeing how much prettier they were inside than their dull exteriors indicated .
We showed them to each other and said `` Would you have guessed '' ? ?
Squatting on our haunches beside the flat stone we broke them on , we were safe behind the high closed gates at the end of the drive : safe from interruption and the observation and possible amusement of the passers-by .
Thus shielded , we played many foolish games in comfortable unselfconsciousness ; ;
even when the fences became a part of the game -- when a vine-embowered gate-post was the Sleeping Beauty's enchanted castle , or when Rapunzel let down her golden hair from beneath the crocketed spire , even then we paid little heed to those who went by on the path outside .
We enjoyed a paradoxical freedom when we were still too young for school .
In the heat of the summer , the garden solitudes were ours alone ; ;
our elders stayed in the dark house or sat fanning on the front porch .
They never troubled themselves about us while we were playing , because the fence formed such a definite boundary and `` Don't go outside the gate '' was a command so impossible of misinterpretation .
We were not , however , entirely unacquainted with the varying aspects of the street .
We were forbidden to swing on the gates , lest they sag on their hinges in a poor-white-trash way , but we could stand on them , when they were latched , rest our chins on the top , and stare and stare , committing to memory , quite unintentionally , all the details that lay before our eyes .
The street that is full now of traffic and parked cars then and for many years drowsed on an August afternoon in the shade of the curbside trees , and silence was a weight , almost palpable , in the air .
Every slight sound that rose against that pressure fell away again , crushed beneath it .
A hay-wagon moved slowly along the gutter , the top of it swept by the low boughs of the maple trees , and loose straws were left hanging tangled among the leaves .
A wheel squeaked on a hub , was still , and squeaked again .
If a child watched its progress he whispered , `` Hay , hay , load of hay -- make a wish and turn away '' , and then stared rigidly in the opposite direction until the sound of the horses' feet returned no more .
When the hay wagon had gone , and an interval passed , a huckster's cart might turn the corner .
The horse walked , the reins were slack , the huckster rode with bowed shoulders , his forearms across his knees .
Sleepily , as if half-reluctant to break the silence , he lifted his voice : `` Rhu-beb-ni-ice nice fresh rhu-beb today '' ! !
The lazy sing-song was spaced in time like the drone of a bumble-bee .
No one seemed to hear him , no one heeded .
The horse plodded on , and he repeated his call .
It became so monotonous as to seem a part of the quietness .
After his passage , the street was empty again .
The sun moved slant-wise across the sky and down ; ;
the trees' shadows circled from street to sidewalk , from sidewalk to lawn .
At four-o'clock , or four-thirty , the coming of the newsboy marked the end of the day ; ;
he tossed a paper toward every front door , and housewives came down to their steps to pick them up and read what their neighbors had been doing .
The streets of any county town were like this on any sunshiny afternoon in summer ; ;
they were like this fifty-odd years ago , and yesterday .
But the fences were still in place fifty-odd years ago , and when we stood on the gate to look over , the sidewalk under our eyes was not cement but two rows of paving stones with grass between and on both sides .
The curb was a line of stone laid edgewise in the dirt and tilted this way and that by frost in the ground or the roots of trees .
Opposite every gate was a hitching post or a stone carriage-step , set with a rusty iron ring for tying a horse .
The street was unpaved and rose steeply toward the center ; ;
it was mud in wet weather and dust , ankle-deep , in dry , and could be crossed only at the corner where there were stepping stones .
It had a bucolic atmosphere that it has lost long since .
The hoofmarks of cattle and the prints of bare feet in the mud or in the dust were as numerous as the traces of shod horses .
Cows were kept in backyard barns , boys were hired to drive them to and from the pasture on the edge of town , and familiar to the ear , morning and evening , were the boys' coaxing voices , the thud of hooves , and the thwack of a stick on cowhide .
It is worth dwelling in some detail on the crisis of this story , because it brings together a number of characteristic elements and makes of them a curious , riddling compound obscurely but centrally significant for Mann's work .
The wife , Amra , and her lover are both savagely portrayed , she as incarnate sensuality , `` voluptuous '' and `` indolent '' , possibly `` a mischief maker '' , with `` a kind of luxurious cunning '' to set against her apparent simplicity , her `` birdlike brain '' .
Lautner , for his part , `` belonged to the present-day race of small artists , who do not demand the utmost of themselves '' , and the bitter description of the type includes such epithets as `` wretched little poseurs '' , the devastating indictment `` they do not know how to be wretched decently and in order '' , and the somewhat extreme prophecy , so far not fulfilled : `` They will be destroyed '' .
The trick these two play upon Jacoby reveals their want not simply of decency but of imagination as well .
His appearance as Lizzy evokes not amusement but horror in the audience ; ;
it is a spectacle absolutely painful , an epiphany of the suffering flesh unredeemed by spirit , untouched by any spirit other than abasement and humiliation .
At the same time the multiple transvestitism involved -- the fat man as girl and as baby , as coquette pretending to be a baby -- touches for a moment horrifyingly upon the secret sources of a life like Jacoby's , upon the sinister dreams which form the sources of any human life .
The music which Lautner has composed for this episode is for the most part `` rather pretty and perfectly banal '' .
But it is characteristic of him , we are told , `` his little artifice '' , to be able to introduce `` into a fairly vulgar and humorous piece of hackwork a sudden phrase of genuine creative art '' .
And this occurs now , at the refrain of Jacoby's song -- at the point , in fact , of the name `` Lizzy '' -- ; ;
a modulation described as `` almost a stroke of genius '' .
`` A miracle , a revelation , it was like a curtain suddenly torn away to reveal something nude '' .
It is this modulation which reveals to Jacoby his own frightful abjection and , simultaneously , his wife's infidelity .
By the same means he perceives this fact as having communicated itself to the audience ; ;
he collapses , and dies .
In the work of every artist , I suppose , there may be found one or more moments which strike the student as absolutely decisive , ultimately emblematic of what it is all about ; ;
not less strikingly so for being mysterious , as though some deeply hidden constatation of thoughts were enciphered in a single image , a single moment .
So here .
The horrifying humor , the specifically sexual embarrassment of the joke gone wrong , the monstrous image of the fat man dressed up as a whore dressing up as a baby ; ;
the epiphany of that quivering flesh ; ;
the bringing together around it of the secret liaison between indolent , mindless sensuality and sharp , shrewd talent , cleverness with an occasional touch of genius ( which , however , does not know `` how to attack the problem of suffering '' ) ; ;
the miraculous way in which music , revelation and death are associated in a single instant -- all this seems a triumph of art , a rather desperate art , in itself ; ;
beyond itself , also , it evokes numerous and distant resonances from the entire body of Mann's work .
When I try to work out my reasons for feeling that this passage is of critical significance , I come up with the following ideas , which I shall express very briefly here and revert to in a later essay .
Love is the crucial dilemma of experience for Mann's heroes .
The dramatic construction of his stories characteristically turns on a situation in which someone is simultaneously compelled and forbidden to love .
The release , the freedom , involved in loving another is either terribly difficult or else absolutely impossible ; ;
and the motion toward it brings disaster .
This prohibition on love has an especially poignant relation to art ; ;
it is particularly the artist ( Tonio Kroger , Aschenbach , Leverkuhn ) who suffers from it .
The specific analogy to the dilemma of love is the problem of the `` breakthrough '' in the realm of art .
Again , the sufferings and disasters produced by any transgression against the commandment not to love are almost invariably associated in one way or another with childhood , with the figure of a child .
Finally , the theatrical ( and perversely erotic ) notions of dressing up , cosmetics , disguise , and especially change of costume ( or singularity of costume , as with Cipolla ) , are characteristically associated with the catastrophes of Mann's stories .
We shall return to these statements and deal with them more fully as the evidence for them accumulates .
For the present it is enough to note that in the grotesque figure of Jacoby , at the moment of his collapse , all these elements come together in prophetic parody .
Professionally a lawyer , that is to say associated with dignity , reserve , discipline , with much that is essentially middle-class , he is compelled by an impossible love to exhibit himself dressed up , disguised -- that is , paradoxically , revealed -- as a child , and , worse , as a whore masquerading as a child .
That this abandonment takes place on a stage , during an ' artistic ' performance , is enough to associate Jacoby with art , and to bring down upon him the punishment for art ; ;
that is , he is suspect , guilty , punishable , as is anyone in Mann's stories who produces illusion , and this is true even though the constant elements of the artist-nature , technique , magic , guilt and suffering , are divided in this story between Jacoby and Lautner .
It appears that the dominant tendency of Mann's early tales , however pictorial or even picturesque the surface , is already toward the symbolic , the emblematic , the expressionistic .
In a certain perfectly definite way , the method and the theme of his stories are one and the same .
Something of this can be learned from `` The Way To The Churchyard '' ( 1901 ) , an anecdote about an old failure whose fit of anger at a passing cyclist causes him to die of a stroke or seizure .
There is no more `` plot '' than that ; ;
only slightly more , perhaps , than a newspaper account of such an incident would give .
The artistic interest , then , lies in what the encounter may be made to represent , in the power of some central significance to draw the details into relevance and meaningfulness .
The first sentence , with its platitudinous irony , announces an emblematic intent : `` The way to the churchyard ran along beside the highroad , ran beside it all the way to the end ; ;
that is to say , to the churchyard '' .
And the action is consistently presented with regard for this distinction .
The highroad , one might say at first , belongs to life , while the way to the churchyard belongs to death .
But that is too simple , and won't hold up .
As the first sentence suggests , both roads belong to death in the end .
But the highroad , according to the description of its traffic , belongs to life as it is lived in unawareness of death , while the way to the churchyard belongs to some other sort of life : a suffering form , an existence wholly comprised in the awareness of death .
Thus , on the highroad , a troop of soldiers `` marched in their own dust and sang '' , while on the footpath one man walks alone .
This man's isolation is not merely momentary , it is permanent .
He is a widower , his three children are dead , he has no one left on earth ; ;
also he is a drunk , and has lost his job on that account .
His name is Praisegod Piepsam , and he is rather fully described as to his clothing and physiognomy in a way which relates him to a sinister type in the author's repertory -- he is a forerunner of those enigmatic strangers in `` Death In Venice '' , for example , who represent some combination of cadaver , exotic , and psychopomp .
This strange person quarrels with a cyclist because the latter is using the path rather than the highroad .
The cyclist , a sufficiently commonplace young fellow , is not named but identified simply as `` Life '' -- that and a license number , which Piepsam uses in addressing him .
`` Life '' points out that `` everybody uses this path '' , and starts to ride on .
Piepsam tries to stop him by force , receives a push in the chest from `` Life '' , and is left standing in impotent and growing rage , while a crowd begins to gather .
His rage assumes a religious form ; ;
that is , on the basis of his own sinfulness and abject wretchedness , Piepsam becomes a prophet who in his ecstasy and in the name of God imprecates doom on Life -- not only the cyclist now , but the audience , the world , as well : `` all you light-headed breed '' .
This passion brings on a fit which proves fatal .
Then an ambulance comes along , and they drive Praisegod Piepsam away .
This is simple enough , but several more points of interest may be mentioned as relevant .
The season , between spring and summer , belongs to life in its carefree aspect .
Piepsam's fatal rage arises not only because he cannot stop the cyclist , but also because God will not stop him ; ;
as Piepsam says to the crowd in his last moments : `` His justice is not of this world '' .
Life is further characterized , in antithesis to Piepsam , as animal : the image of a dog , which appears at several places , is first given as the criterion of amiable , irrelevant interest aroused by life considered simply as a spectacle : a dog in a wagon is `` admirable '' , `` a pleasure to contemplate '' ; ;
another wagon has no dog , and therefore is `` devoid of interest '' .
Piepsam calls the cyclist `` cur '' and `` puppy '' among other things , and at the crisis of his fit a little fox-terrier stands before him and howls into his face .
The ambulance is drawn by two `` charming '' little horses .
Piepsam is not , certainly , religious in any conventional sense .
His religiousness is intimately , or dialectically , connected with his sinfulness ; ;
the two may in fact be identical .
His unsuccessful strivings to give up drink are represented as religious strivings ; ;
he keeps a bottle in a wardrobe at home , and `` before this wardrobe Praisegod Piepsam had before now gone literally on his knees , and in his wrestlings had bitten his tongue -- and still in the end capitulated '' .
The cyclist , by contrast , blond and blue-eyed , is simply unreflective , unproblematic Life , `` blithe and carefree '' .
`` He made no claims to belong to the great and mighty of this earth '' .
Piepsam is grotesque , a disturbing parody ; ;
his end is ridiculous and trivial .
He is `` a man raving mad on the way to the churchyard '' .
But he is more interesting than the others , the ones who come from the highroad to watch him , more interesting than Life considered as a cyclist .
And if I have gone into so much detail about so small a work , that is because it is also so typical a work , representing the germinal form of a conflict which remains essential in Mann's writing : the crude sketch of Piepsam contains , in its critical , destructive and self-destructive tendencies , much that is enlarged and illuminated in the figures of , for instance , Naphta and Leverkuhn .
In method as well as in theme this little anecdote with its details selected as much for expressiveness and allegory as for `` realism '' , anticipates a kind of musical composition , as well as a kind of fictional composition , in which , as Leverkuhn says , `` there shall be nothing unthematic '' .
It resembles , too , pictures such as Durer and Bruegel did , in which all that looks at first to be solely pictorial proves on inspection to be also literary , the representation of a proverb , for example , or a deadly sin .
`` Gladius Dei '' ( 1902 ) resembles `` The Way To The Churchyard '' in its representation of a conflict between light and dark , between `` Life '' and a spirit of criticism , negation , melancholy , but it goes considerably further in characterizing the elements of this conflict .
The monk Savonarola , brought over from the Renaissance and placed against the background of Munich at the turn of the century , protests against the luxurious works displayed in the art-shop of M. Bluthenzweig ; ;
in particular against a Madonna portrayed in a voluptuous style and modeled , according to gossip , upon the painter's mistress .
Hieronymus , like Piepsam , makes his protest quite in vain , and his rejection , though not fatal , is ridiculous and humiliating ; ;
he is simply thrown out of the shop by the porter .
On the street outside , Hieronymus envisions a holocaust of the vanities of this world , such a burning of artistic and erotic productions as his namesake actually brought to pass in Florence , and prophetically he issues his curse : `` Gladius Dei super terram cito et velociter '' .
The `` reality '' to which they respond is rationally empty and their art is an imitation of the inescapable powerfulness of this unknown and empty world .
Their artistic rationale is given to the witness of unreason .
These polar concerns ( imitation vs. formalism ) reflect a philosophical and religious situation which has been developing over a long period of time .
The breakdown of classical structures of meaning in all realms of western culture has given rise to several generations of artists who have documented the disintegrative processes .
Thus the image of man has suffered complete fragmentation in personal and spiritual qualities , and complete objectification in sub-human and quasi-mechanistic powers .
The image of the world tends to reflect the hostility and indifference of man or else to dissolve into empty spaces and overwhelming mystery .
The image of God has simply disappeared .
All such imitations of negative quality have given rise to a compensatory response in the form of a heroic and highly individualistic humanism : if man can neither know nor love reality as it is , he can at least invent an artistic `` reality '' which is its own world and which can speak to man of purely personal and subjective qualities capable of being known and worthy of being loved .
The person of the artist becomes a final bastion of meaning in a world rendered meaningless by the march of events and the decay of classical religious and philosophical systems .
Whatever pole of this contrast one emphasizes and whatever the tension between these two approaches to understanding the artistic imagination , it will be readily seen that they are not mutually exclusive , that they belong together .
Without the decay of a sense of objective reference ( except as the imitation of mystery ) , the stress on subjective invention would never have been stimulated into being .
And although these insights into the nature of art may be in themselves insufficient for a thoroughgoing philosophy of art , their peculiar authenticity in this day and age requires that they be taken seriously and gives promise that from their very substance , new and valid chapters in the philosophy of art may be written .
For better or worse we cannot regard `` imitation '' in the arts in the simple mode of classical rationalism or detached realism .
A broader concept of imitation is needed , one which acknowledges that true invention is important , that the artist's creativity in part transcends the non-artistic causal factors out of which it arises .
On the other hand , we cannot regard artistic invention as pure , uncaused , and unrelated to the times in which it occurs .
We need a doctrine of imitation to save us from the solipsism and futility of pure formalism .
Accordingly , it is the aim of this essay to advance a new theory of imitation ( which I shall call mimesis in order to distinguish it from earlier theories of imitation ) and a new theory of invention ( which I shall call symbol for reasons to be stated hereafter ) .
The mimetic imagination in the arts
The word `` mimesis '' ( `` imitation '' ) is usually associated with Plato and Aristotle .
For Plato , `` imitation '' is twice removed from reality , being a poor copy of physical appearance , which in itself is a poor copy of ideal essence .
All artistic and mythological representations , therefore , are `` imitations of imitations '' and are completely superseded by the truth value of `` dialectic '' , the proper use of the inquiring intellect .
In Plato's judgment , the arts play a meaningful role in society only in the education of the young , prior to the full development of their intellectual powers .
Presupposed in Plato's system is a doctrine of levels of insight , in which a certain kind of detached understanding is alone capable of penetrating to the most sublime wisdom .
Aristotle also tended to stratify all aspects of human nature and activity into levels of excellence and , like Plato , he put the pure and unimpassioned intellect on the top level .
The Poetics , in affirming that all human arts are `` modes of imitation '' , gives a more serious role to artistic mimesis than did Plato .
But Aristotle kept the principle of levels and even augmented it by describing in the Poetics what kinds of character and action must be imitated if the play is to be a vehicle of serious and important human truths .
For both Plato and Aristotle artistic mimesis , in contrast to the power of dialectic , is relatively incapable of expressing the character of fundamental reality .
The central concern of Erich Auerbach's impressive volume called Mimesis is to describe the shift from a classic theory of imitation ( based upon a recognition of levels of truth ) to a Christian theory of imitation in which the levels are dissolved .
Following the theme of Incarnation in the Gospels , the Christian artist and critic sees in the most commonplace and ordinary events `` figures '' of divine power and reality .
Here artistic realism involves the audience in an impassioned participation in events whose overtones and implications are transcendent .
Artistic mimesis under Christian influence records the involvement of all persons , however humble , in a divine drama .
The artist , unlike the philosopher , is not a removed observer aiming at neutral and rarified high levels of abstraction .
He is the conveyor of a sacred reality by which he has been grasped .
I have chosen to use the word `` mimesis '' in its Christian rather than its classic implications and to discover in the concrete forms of both art and myth powers of theological expression which , as in the Christian mind , are the direct consequence of involvement in historical experience , which are not reserved , as in the Greek mind , only to moments of theoretical reflection .
In the first instance , `` mimesis '' is here used to mean the recalling of experience in terms of vivid images rather than in terms of abstract ideas or conventional designations .
By `` image '' is meant not only a visual presentation , but also remembered sensations of any of the five senses plus the feelings which are immediately conjoined therewith .
This is the primary function of the imagination operating in the absence of the original experiential stimulus by which the images were first appropriated .
Mimesis is the nearest possible thing to the actual re-living of experience , in which the imagining person recovers through images something of the force and depth characteristic of experience itself .
The images themselves , like their counterparts in experience , are not neutral qualities to be surveyed dispassionately ; ;
they are fields of force exerting a unique influence on the sensibilities and a unique relatedness to one another .
They bring an inextricable component of value within themselves , with attractions and repulsions native to their own quality .
As in experience one is seized by given entities and their interrelations and is forced to respond in value feelings to them , so one is similarly seized in the mimetic presentation of images .
Mimesis here is not to be confused with literalism or realism in the conventional sense .
A word taken in its dictionary meaning , a photographic image of a recognizable object , the mere picturing of a `` scene '' tends to lose experiential vividness and to connote such conventional abstractions as to invite neutral reception without the incitement of value feelings .
Similarly experience itself can be conventionalized so that people react to certain preconceived clues for behavior without awareness of the vitality of their experiential field .
A truly vivid imagination moves beyond the conventional recollection to a sense of immediacy .
The mimetic character of the imaginative consciousness tends to express itself in the presentation of artistic forms and materials .
When words can be used in a more fresh and primitive way so that they strike with the force of sights and sounds , when tones of sound and colors of paint and the carven shape all strike the sensibilities with an undeniable force of data in and of themselves , compelling the observer into an attitude of attention , all this imitates the way experience itself in its deepest character strikes upon the door of consciousness and clamors for entrance .
These are like the initial ways in which the world forces itself upon the self and thrusts the self into decision and choice .
The presence of genuine mimesis in art is marked by the persistence with which the work demands attention and compels valuation even though it is but vaguely understood .
Underlying these conceptions of mimesis are certain presuppositions concerning the nature of primary human experience which require some exposition before the main argument can proceed .
Experience is not seen , as it is in classical rationalism , as presenting us initially with clear and distinct objects simply located in space and registering their character , movements , and changes on the tabula rasa of an uninvolved intellect .
Neither is primary experience understood according to the attitude of modern empiricism in which nothing is thought to be received other than signals of sensory qualities producing their responses in the appropriate sense organs .
Primary feelings of the world come neither as a collection of clearly known objects ( houses , trees , implements , etc. ) nor a collection of isolated and neutral sensory qualities .
In contrast to all this , primary data are data of a self involved in environing processes and powers .
The most primitive feelings are rudimentary value feelings , both positive and negative : a desire to appropriate this or that part of the environment into oneself ; ;
a desire to avoid and repel this or that other part .
These desires presuppose a sense of causally efficacious powers in which one is involved , some working for one's good , others threatening ill .
Gone is the tabula rasa of the mind .
In its place is a passionate consciousness grasped and molded to feelings of positive or negative values even as the actions of one's life are determined by constellations of process in which one is caught .
The principal defender of this view of primary experience as `` causal efficacy '' is Alfred North Whitehead .
Our most elemental and unavoidable impressions , he says , are those of being involved in a large arena of powers which have a longer past than our own , which are interrelated in a vast movement through the present toward the future .
We feel the quality of these powers initially as in some degree wholesome or threatening .
Later abstractive and rational processes may indicate errors of judgment in these apprehensions of value , but the apprehensions themselves are the primary stuff of experience .
It takes a great deal of abstraction to free oneself from the primitive impression of larger unities of power and influence and to view one's world simply as a collection of sense data arranged in such and such sequence and pattern , devoid of all power to move the feelings and actions except in so far as they present themselves for inspection .
Whitehead is here questioning David Hume's understanding of the nature of experience ; ;
he is questioning , also , every epistemology which stems from Hume's presupposition that experience is merely sense data in abstraction from causal efficacy , and that causal efficacy is something intellectually imputed to the world , not directly perceived .
What Hume calls `` sensation '' is what Whitehead calls `` perception in the mode of presentational immediacy '' which is a sophisticated abstraction from perception in the mode of causal efficacy .
As long as perception is seen as composed only of isolated sense data , most of the quality and interconnectedness of existence loses its objectivity , becomes an invention of consciousness , and the result is a philosophical scepticism .
Whitehead contends that the human way of understanding existence as a unity of interlocking and interdependent processes which constitute each other and which cause each other to be and not to be is possible only because the basic form of such an understanding , for all its vagueness and tendency to mistake the detail , is initially given in the way man feels the world .
In this respect experience is broader and full of a richer variety of potential meanings than the mind of man or any of his arts or culture are capable of making clear and distinct .
A chief characteristic of experience in the mode of causal efficacy is one of derivation from the past .
Both I and my feelings come up out of a chain of events that fan out into the past into sources that are ultimately very unlike the entity which I now am .
After only eighteen years of non-interference , there were already indications of melioration , though `` in a slight degree '' , to be sure .
There were more indications by the mid-twentieth century .
I leave it to the statisticians to say what they were , but I noticed several a few years ago , during an automobile ride from Memphis to Hattiesburg .
In town after town my companion pointed out the Negro school and the White school , and in every instance the former made a better appearance ( it was newer , for one thing ) .
It really looked as if a change of the sort predicted by Booker T. Washington had been going on .
But with the renewal of interference in 1954 ( as with its beginning in 1835 ) , the improvement was impaired .
For over a hundred years Southerners have felt that the North was picking on them .
It's infuriating , this feeling that one is being picked on , continually , constantly .
By what right of superior virtue , Southerners ask , do the people of the North do this ? ?
The traditional strategy of the South has been to expose the vices of the North , to demonstrate that the North possessed no superior virtue , to `` show the world that '' as James's Christopher Newman said to his adversaries ) `` however bad I may be , you're not quite the people to say it '' .
In the pre-Civil War years , the South argued that the slave was not less humanely treated than the factory worker of the North .
At the present time , the counter-attack takes the line that there's no more of the true spirit of `` integration '' in the North than in the South .
The line is a pretty good one .
People talk about `` the law of the land '' .
The expression has become quite a cliche .
But people can't be made to integrate , socialize ( the two are inseparable by Southern standards ) by law .
I was having lunch not long ago ( apologies to N. V. Peale ) with three distinguished historians ( one specializing in the European Middle Ages , one in American history , and one in the Far East ) , and I asked them if they could name instances where the general mores had been radically changed with `` deliberate speed , majestic instancy '' ( Francis Thompson's words for the Hound Of Heaven's Pursuit ) by judicial fiat .
They didn't seem to be able to think of any .
A Virginia judge a while back cited a Roman jurist to the effect that ten years might be a reasonable length of time for such a change .
But I suspect that the old Roman was referring to change made under military occupation -- the sort of change which Tacitus was talking about when he said , `` They make a desert , and call it peace '' ( `` Solitudinem faciunt , pacem appellant '' .
) .
Moreover , the law of the land is not irrevocable ; ;
it can be changed ; ;
it has been , many times .
Mr. Justice Taney's Dred Scott decision in 1857 was unpopular in the North , and soon became a dead letter .
Prohibition was the law of the land , but it was unpopular ( how many of us oldsters took up drinking in prohibition days , drinking was so gay , so fashionable , especially in the sophisticated Northeast ! !
) and was repealed .
The cliche loses its talismanic virtue in the light of a little history .
The Declaration of Independence says that `` governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed '' .
The phrase `` consent of the governed '' needs a hard look .
How do we define it '' ? ?
Is the consent of the governed a numerical majority ? ?
Calhoun dealt with this question in his `` Disquisition On Government '' .
To guard against the tyranny of a numerical majority , Calhoun developed his theory of `` concurrent majority '' , which , he said , `` by giving to each portion of the community which may be unequally affected by the action of government , a negative on the others , prevents all partial or local legislation '' .
Who will say that our country is even now a homogeneous community ? ?
That regional peculiarities do not still exist ? ?
That the Court order does not unequally affect the Southern region ? ?
Who will deny that in a vast portion of the South the Federal action is incompatible with the Jeffersonian concept of `` the consent of the governed '' ? ?
Circumstances alter cases .
A friend of mine in New Mexico said the Court order had caused no particular trouble out there , that all had gone as merry as a marriage bell .
He seemed a little surprised that it should have caused any particular trouble anywhere .
I murmured something about a possible difference between New Mexico's history and Mississippi's .
One can meet with aloofness almost anywhere : the THIDIU viewpoint , It Doesn't Affect Us ! !
Southern Liberals ( there are a good many ) -- especially if they're rich -- often exhibit blithe insouciance .
The trouble here is that it's almost too easy to take the high moral ground when it doesn't cost you anything .
You've already sent your daughter to Miss X's select academy for girls and your son to Mr. Y's select academy for boys , and you can be as liberal as you please with strict impunity .
If there's no suitable academy in your own neighborhood , there's always New England .
New England academies welcome fugitives from the provinces , South as well as West .
They may even enroll a colored student or two for show , though he usually turns out to be from Thailand , or any place other than the American South .
It would be interesting to know how much `` integration '' there is in the famous , fashionable colleges and prep schools of New England .
A recent newspaper report said there were five Negroes in the 1960 graduating class of nearly one thousand at Yale ; ;
that is , about one-half of one per cent , which looks pretty `` tokenish '' to me , especially in an institution which professes to be `` national '' .
I must confess that I prefer the Liberal who is personally affected , who is willing to send his own children to a mixed school as proof of his faith .
I leave out of account the question of the best interests of the children , the question of what their best interests really are .
I'm talking about the grand manner of the Liberal -- North and South -- who is not affected personally .
If these people were denied a voice ( do they have a moral right to a voice ? ?
) , what voices would be left ? ?
Who is involved willy nilly ? ?
Well , after everybody has followed the New England pattern of segregating one's children into private schools , only the poor folks are left .
And it is precisely in this poorer economic class that one finds , and has always found , the most racial friction .
A dear , respected friend of mine , who like myself grew up in the South and has spent many years in New England , said to me not long ago : `` I can't forgive New England for rejecting all complicity '' .
Being a teacher of American literature , I remembered Whittier's `` Massachusetts To Virginia '' , where he said : `` But that one dark loathsome burden ye must stagger with alone , And reap the bitter harvest which ye yourselves have sown '' .
There is a legend ( Hawthorne records it in his `` English Notebooks '' .
And one finds it again in Thomas Nelson Page ) to the effect that the Mayflower on its second voyage brought a cargo of Negro slaves .
Whether historically a fact or not , the legend has a certain symbolic value .
Complicity is an embarrassing word .
It is something which most of us try to get out from under .
Like the cowboy in Stephen Crane's `` Blue Hotel '' , we run around crying , `` Well , I didn't do anything , did I '' ? ?
Robert Penn Warren puts it this way in `` Brother To Dragons '' : `` The recognition of complicity is the beginning of innocence '' , where innocence , I think , means about the same thing as redemption .
A man must be able to say , `` Father , I have sinned '' , or there is no hope for him .
Lincoln understood this better than most when he said in his `` Second Inaugural '' that God `` gives to both North and South this terrible war , as the woe due to those by whom the offense came '' .
He also spoke of `` the wealth piled by the bondsman's two hundred and fifty years in unrequited toil '' .
Lincoln was historian and economist enough to know that a substantial portion of this wealth had accumulated in the hands of the descendants of New Englanders engaged in the slave trade .
After how many generations is such wealth ( mounting all the while through the manipulations of high finance ) purified of taint ? ?
It is a question which New Englanders long ago put out of their minds .
But didn't they get off too easy ? ?
The slaves never shared in their profits , while they did share , in a very real sense , in the profits of the slave-owners : they were fed , clothed , doctored , and so forth ; ;
they were the beneficiaries of responsible , paternalistic care .
Emerson -- Platonist , idealist , doctrinaire -- sounded a high Transcendental note in his `` Boston Hymn '' , delivered in 1863 in the Boston Music Hall amidst thundering applause : `` Pay ransom to the owner and fill the bag to the brim .
Who is the owner ? ?
The slave is owner , And ever was .
Pay him '' ! !
It is the abstractionism , the unrealism , of the pure idealist .
It ignores the sordid financial aspects ( quite conveniently , too , for his audience , who could indulge in moral indignation without visible , or even conscious , discomfort , their money from the transaction having been put away long ago in a good antiseptic brokerage ) .
Like Pilate , they had washed their hands .
But can one , really ? ?
Can God be mocked , ever , in the long run ? ?
New Englanders were a bit sensitive on the subject of their complicity in Negro slavery at the time of the drafting of the Declaration of Independence , as Jefferson explained in his `` Autobiography '' : ``
The clause reprobating the enslaving the inhabitants of Africa was struck out in complaisance to South Carolina and Georgia , who had never attempted to restrain the importation of slaves , and who on the contrary still wished to continue it .
Our Northern brethren also I believe felt a little tender under those censures ; ;
for though their people had very few slaves themselves , yet they had been pretty considerable carriers of them to others '' .
But that was a long time ago .
The New England conscience became desensitized .
George W. Cable ( naturalized New Englander ) , writing in 1889 from `` Paradise Road , Northampton '' ( lovely symbolic name ) , agitated continuously the `` Southern question '' .
It was nice to be able to isolate it .
New England , as everyone knows , has long been schoolmaster to the Nation .
There one finds concentrated in a comparatively small area the chief universities , colleges , and preparatory schools of the United States .
Why should this be so ? ?
It is true that New England , more than any other section , was dedicated to education from the start .
But I think that something more than this is involved .
How did it happen , for example , that the state university , that great symbol of American democracy , failed to flourish in New England as it did in other parts of the country ? ?
Isn't it a bit odd that the three states of Southern New England ( Massachusetts , Connecticut , and Rhode Island ) have had state institutions of university status only in the very recent past , these institutions having previously been A & M colleges ? ?
Was it supposed , perchance , that A & M ( vocational training , that is ) was quite sufficient for the immigrant class which flooded that part of the New England world in the post-Civil War period , the immigrants having been brought in from Southern Europe , to work in the mills , to make up for the labor shortage caused by migration to the West ? ?
Is it not ironical that Roger Williams's state , Rhode Island , should have been the very last of the forty-eight to establish a state university ? ?
The state universities of Maine , New Hampshire , And Vermont are older and more `` respectable '' ; ;
they had less immigration to contend with .
A Yale historian , writing a few years ago in The Yale Review , said : `` We in New England have long since segregated our children '' .
He was referring not only to the general college situation but more especially to the preparatory schools .
And what a galaxy of those adorns that fair land ! !
I don't propose to go into their history , but I have one or two surmises .
One is that they were established , or gained eminence , under pressure provided by these same immigrants , from whom the old families wished to segregate their children .
In the early days of a homogeneous population , the public school was quite satisfactory .
Among the recipients of the Nobel Prize for Literature more than half are practically unknown to readers of English .
Of these there are surely few that would be more rewarding discoveries than Verner Von Heidenstam , the Swedish poet and novelist who received the award in 1916 and whose centennial was celebrated two years ago .
Equally a master of prose and verse , he recreates the glory of Sweden in the past and continues it into the present .
In the following sketch we shall present a brief outline of his life and let him as much as possible speak for himself .
Heidenstam was born in 1859 , of a prosperous family .
On his father's side he was of German descent , on his mother's he came of the old Swedish nobility .
The family estate was situated near Vadstena on Lake Vattern in south central Sweden .
It is a lonely , rather desolate region , but full of legendary and historic associations .
As a boy in a local school he was shy and solitary , absorbed in his fondness for nature and his visions of Sweden's ancient glory .
He liked to fancy himself as a chieftain and to dress for the part .
Being somewhat delicate in health , at the age of sixteen he was sent to Southern Europe , for which he at once developed a passion , so that he spent nearly all of the following ten years abroad , at first in Italy , then in Greece , Egypt , Asia Minor , and Palestine .
In one of his summers at home he married , to the great disapproval of his father , who objected because of his extreme youth .
Deciding to become a painter , he entered the studio of Gerome in Paris , where he enjoyed the life of the artists , but soon found that whatever talent he might have did not lie in that direction .
He gives us an account of this in his lively and humorous poem , `` The Happy Artists '' .
`` I scanned the world through printed symbol swart , And through the beggar's rags I strove to see The inner man .
I looked unceasingly With my cold mind and with my burning heart '' .
In this final line , we have the key to his nature .
Few writers have better understood their deepest selves .
Heidenstam could never be satisfied by surface .
It may , however , be noted that his gift for color and imagery must have been greatly stimulated by his stay in Paris .
The first result of Heidenstam's long sojourn abroad was a volume of poems , Pilgrimage And Wander-Years ( Vallfart och Vandringsar ) , published in 1888 .
It was a brilliant debut , so much so indeed that it aroused a new vitality in the younger poets , as did Byron's Childe Harold .
Professor Fredrik Book , Sweden's foremost critic of the period , acclaims it as follows : `` In this we have the verse of a painter ; ;
strongly colorful , plastic , racy , vivid .
In a bold , sometimes careless , form there is nothing academic ; ;
all is seen and felt and experienced , the observation is sharp and the imagination lively .
The young poet-painter reproduces the French life of the streets ; ;
he tells stories of the Thousand and One Nights , and conjures up before us the bazaars of Damascus .
In the care-free indolence of the East he sees the last reflection of the old happy existence , and for that reason he loves it .
And yet amid all the gay hedonism in Pilgrimage And Wander-Years is a cycle of short poems , `` Thoughts In Loneliness '' , filled with brooding , melancholy , and sombre longing '' .
Of the longer pieces of the volume none is so memorable as `` Nameless And Immortal '' , which at once took rank among the finest poems ever written in the Swedish language .
It celebrates the unknown architect who designed the temple of Neptune at Paestum , next to the Parthenon the noblest example of Grecian classic style now in existence .
On the eve of his return to their native Naxos he speaks with his wife of the masterpiece which rises before them in its completed perfection .
The supreme object of their lives is now fulfilled , says the wife , her husband has achieved immortality .
Not so , he answers , it is not the architect but the temple that is immortal .
`` The man's true reputation is his work '' .
The short poems grouped at the end of the volume as `` Thoughts in Loneliness '' is , as Professor Book indicated , in sharp contrast with the others .
It consists of fragmentary personal revelations , such as `` The Spark '' : `` There is a spark dwells deep within my soul .
To get it out into the daylight's glow Is my life's aim both first and last , the whole .
It slips away , it burns and tortures me .
That little spark is all the wealth I know , That little spark is my life's misery '' .
A dominant motive is the poet's longing for his homeland and its boyhood associations : `` Not men-folk , but the fields where I would stray , The stones where as a child I used to play '' .
He is utterly disappointed in himself and in the desultory life he has been leading .
What he really wants is to find `` a sacred cause '' to which he can honestly devote himself .
This restless individualism found its answer when he returned to live nearly all the rest of his life in Sweden .
His cause was to commemorate the glory of her past and to incite her people to perpetuate it in the present .
He did not , however , find himself at once .
His next major work , completed in 1892 , was a long fantastic epic in prose , entitled Hans Alienus , which Professor Book describes as a monument on the grave of his carefree and indolent youth .
The hero , who is himself , is represented as a pilgrim in the storied lands of the East , a sort of Faustus type , who , to quote from Professor Book again , `` even in the pleasure gardens of Sardanapalus can not cease from his painful search after the meaning of life .
He is driven back by his yearning to the wintry homeland of his fathers in the forest of Tiveden '' .
From this time on Heidenstam proceeded to find his deeper self .
By the death of his father in 1888 he had come into possession of the family estate and had re-assumed its traditions .
He did not , however , settle back into acquiescence with things as they were .
Like his friend and contemporary August Strindberg he had little patience with collective mediocrity .
He saw Sweden as a country of smug and narrow provincialism , indifferent to the heroic spirit of its former glory .
Strindberg's remedy for this condition was to tear down the old structures and build anew from the ground up .
Heidenstam's conception , on the contrary , was to revive the present by the memories of the past .
Whether in prose or poetry , all of Heidenstam's later work was concerned with Sweden .
With the first of a group of historical novels , The Charles Men ( Karolinerna ) , published in 1897-8 , he achieved the masterpiece of his career .
In scope and power it can only be compared to Tolstoy's War And Peace .
About one-third as long , it is less intimate and detailed , but better coordinated , more concise and more dramatic .
Though it centers around the brilliant and enigmatic figure of Charles 12 , , the true hero is not finally the king himself .
Hence the title of the book , referring to the soldiers and subjects of the king ; ;
on the fatal battlefield of Poltava , to quote from the novel , `` the wreath he twined for himself slipped down upon his people '' .
The Charles Men consists not of a connected narrative but of a group of short stories , each depicting a special phase of the general subject .
Somewhat uneven in interest for an average reader , eight or ten of these are among the finest of their kind in literature .
They comprise a great variety of scene and interest : grim episodes of war , idyllic interludes , superb canvases of world-shaking events , and delightfully humorous sketches of odd characters .
The general effect is tragic .
Almost nothing is said of Charles' spectacular victories , the central theme being the heroic loyalty of the Swedish people to their idolized king in misfortune and defeat .
To carry out this exalted conception the author has combined the vivid realism and imaginative power we have noticed in his early poetry and carried them out on a grand scale .
His peculiar gift , as had been suggested before , is his intensity .
George Meredith has said that fervor is the core of style .
Of few authors is this more true than of Heidenstam .
The Charles Men has a tremendous range of characters , of common folk even more than of major figures .
The career of Charles 12 , is obviously very similar to that of Napoleon .
His ideal was Alexander of Macedon , as Napoleon's was Julius Caesar .
His purpose , however , was not to establish an empire , but to assert the principle of divine justice .
Each aspired to be a god in human form , but with each it was a different kind of god .
Each failed catastrophically in an invasion of Russia and each brought ruin on the country that worshipped him .
Each is still glorified as a national hero .
The first half of The Charles Men , ending on the climax of the battle of Poltava in 1709 , is more dramatically coherent than the second .
After the collapse of that desperate and ill-fated campaign the character of the king degenerated for a time into a futility that was not merely pitiable but often ridiculous .
Like Napoleon , he was the worst of losers .
There are , however , some wonderful chapters at the beginning of the second part , concerning the reactions of the Swedes in adversity .
Then more than ever before did they show their fortitude and patient cheerfulness .
This comes out in `` When The Bells Ring '' , which describes the rallying of the peasants in southern Sweden to repel an invasion by the Danes .
In `` The King's Ride '' , Charles breaks out of a long period of petulance and inertia , regains his old self , escapes from Turkey , and finally reaches his own land after an absence of eighteen years .
He finds it in utter misery and desolation .
All his people ask for is no more war .
But he plunges into yet another , this time with Norway , and is killed in an assault on the fortress of Fredrikshall , being only thirty-six years of age when he died .
He had become king at fifteen .
Then suddenly there was a tremendous revulsion of popular feeling .
From being a hated tyrant and madman he was now the symbol of all that was noblest and best in the history of Sweden .
This is brought out in the next to last chapter of the book , `` A Hero's Funeral '' , written in the form of an impassioned prose poem .
Slowly the procession of warriors and statesmen passes through the snow beside the black water and into the brilliantly lighted cathedral , the shrine of so many precious memories .
The guns are fired , the hymns are sung , and the body of Charles is carried down to the vault and laid beside the tombs of his ancestors .
As he had longed to be , he became the echo of a saga .
Heidenstam wrote four other works of fiction about earlier figures revered in Swedish memory .
Excellent in their way , they lack the wide appeal of The Charles Men , and need not detain us here .
It is different with his volume The Swedes And Their Chieftains ( Svenskarna och deras Hovdingar ) , a history intended for the general reader and particularly suited for high school students .
Admirably written , it is a perfect introduction to Swedish history for readers of other countries .
Some of the earlier episodes have touches of the supernatural , as suited to the legendary background .
These are suggestive of Selma Lagerlof .
Especially touching is the chapter , `` The Little Sister '' , about a king's daughter who became a nun in the convent of St. Birgitta .
The record teems with romance and adventure .
Gustaf Vasa is a superb example , and Charles 10 , , the conqueror of Denmark , hardly less so .
Of Gustavus Adolphus and Charles 12 , it is unnecessary to speak .
Today the private detective will also investigate insurance claims or handle divorce cases , but his primary function remains what it has always been , to assist those who have money in their unending struggle with those who have not .
It is from this unpromising background that the fictional private detective was recruited .
The mythological private eye differs from his counterpart in real life in two essential ways .
On the one hand , he does not work for a large agency , but is almost always self-employed .
