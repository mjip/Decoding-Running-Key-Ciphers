In the Industrial Products Division , the company manufactures and markets a wide line of precision gaging and inspection equipment , machinists' tools -- including micrometers , Vernier calipers , and accessories .
In the Cutting Tool Division , the principal products include a wide variety of high speed steel milling cutters , end mills and saws .
Sales and net income for the year ended December 31 , 1960 showed an improvement over 1959 .
Net income was $2,557,111 , or $3.11 per share on 821,220 common shares currently outstanding , as compared to $2,323,867 or $2.82 per share in 1959 , adjusted to the same number of shares .
Sales and other operating income increased 25.1% from $24,926,615 in 1959 to $31,179,816 in 1960 .
This increase was sufficient to overcome the effect on net income of higher costs of manufacture and increased expenditures on research and development .
In spite of the fact that our largest market , the textile industry , was affected substantially by the current decline in business activity , we have been able to produce and deliver our machines throughout the year 1960 at a rate materially higher than during 1959 .
Outlook for current year
Our current rate of incoming orders has now contracted and unless this trend can be reversed , our production for 1961 will be lower than for 1960 .
However , the healthy inventory position of the textile industry lends support to the broadly expressed belief that improvement in that industry can be expected by the second half of 1961 .
Need for sound tax policy
In connection with our continuing development of new and more efficient mill machinery , a sounder U. S. income tax policy on depreciation of production equipment , enabling the mills to charge off the cost of new machines on a more realistic basis , could , if adopted , have favorable effects on Leesona's business in the next few years .
Such a depreciation policy would also , we believe , prove a very important factor in strengthening the competitive position of the U. S. textile and other industries , thus helping to strengthen the position of the dollar in foreign exchange .
Research and development
Our research and development program , serving as it does an industry which must compete against low-cost production throughout the world , continues to have primary emphasis at Leesona .
This program is based on the policy of designing and building efficient machines which will help produce better textile values -- fabrics whose cost in relation to quality , fashion and utility provide the consumer with better textile products for the money .
Such policy involves continuing effort to improve on existing mill equipment , in terms of efficiency and versatility .
But more important , we believe , it must concentrate on the development of entirely new concepts in textile processing as do the Unifil loom winder and our more recent Uniconer automatic coning machine .
Budget increased
On this basis , our already substantial budget for research and development has been further increased in recent years in order to finance the continuing engineering and design work essential to Leesona's future growth in sales and earnings .
Much of this necessary increase in research and development , though properly chargeable to current expenses , is not reflected in earnings until projects are completed and the new machines sold in quantity , usually over a period of several years .
Stretch yarn machines
In December we began to ship our ultra-high-speed stretch yarn machines .
These machines produce the higher quality stretch yarns required in weaving stretch and textured fabrics .
During the past year , great progress has been made by the weaving mills in creating new stretch and textured fabrics .
Fashion centers are now predicting broad acceptance of sports apparel and improved `` wash and wear '' dresses and blouses made from these fabrics .
This machine , operating at speeds up to 350,000 revolutions per minute , is believed to provide one of the fastest mechanical operations in industry today .
It transfers yarn directly from the producers' largest package into ideal supply packages for use on Unifil loom winders in weaving stretch yarn fabrics .
Large-package twister
Our new large-package ring twister for glass fiber yarns is performing well in our customers' mills .
Later in the year , additional types of this Leesona twister will be made available to mills for other man-made fibers and natural yarns .
These machines are designed to provide higher operating speeds , larger yarn packages , and greater flexibility of application to different types of yarn .
This we believe will substantially broaden the potential market for the equipment .
Uniconer
Major activity at Providence in 1961 will involve the scheduled completion of tooling for production of the Uniconer automatic coning machine .
This work is progressing on schedule and we expect to make initial shipments in the fourth quarter of this year .
This machine was demonstrated in two textile machinery exhibitions last year and was well received by the industry .
The potential market for the machine should be comparable to that of the Unifil loom winder .
The Uniconer has several outstanding features -- it operates with much greater efficiency than existing equipment ; ;
it incorporates an automatic knot-tying device on each spindle , and it will knot a break in the yarn in 10 seconds as well as tie in new bobbins as the running end is exhausted .
Because the bobbin-to-cone winding process is a relatively high-cost operation for the mill , the almost complete automation provided by the Uniconer can mean important economies in textile production , at the same time upgrading quality .
Many mills have already placed firm orders for this machine .
New Unifil application
A new application for the Unifil loom winder , running single filling for box looms , will broaden mill use of this equipment .
Take-up machines
A new spinning take-up machine has been developed to facilitate the use of our take-up machine in the production of thermoplastic yarns .
It is equipped with electronic controls that can be set to hold precise tension and speed .
This new machine takes up filament yarn from spinneret or extruder and winds large packages at speeds up to 6,000 feet per minute .
It is equipped with an automatic threading device to reduce waste and handling time .
Our take-up machines and our twister-coners are undergoing important pilot plant testing for application with new high polymer yarns , in several fiber producing plants .
We look forward to a stronger position in this expanding field .
Diversification plans
We are interested in further diversification into other fields of capital goods , or components for industrial products , and have recently intensified our efforts in that direction .
Patterson Moos research
Our Patterson Moos Research Division has made further very encouraging progress in development of fuel cells .
The cooperation of our exclusive American licensee , Pratt & Whitney Aircraft Division of United Aircraft Corporation , has been important in this work .
In addition to its major effort on fuel cells , Patterson Moos Research Division is continuing to carry on research in other fields , both under contract for the Defense Department , other government agencies and for our own account .
PMR is currently supplying components vital to the Titan and Minuteman programs .
We have recently entered into an agreement with Compagnie Generale De Telegraphie Sans Fil ( CSF ) of France for the exclusive exchange of technical information on thermoelectric materials .
The agreement gives us rights for manufacturing and marketing of such materials in the United States .
Initially we will import the thermoelectric materials and modules from France but later we will manufacture in this country .
There is a rapidly growing demand for this material , primarily from the military .
Further research , we believe , will develop important commercial applications .
A project for the Air Force has been completed in which the NAIR infrared detecting device was developed for area monitoring of noxious or dangerous gases .
We are initiating research on the use of solid state materials for infrared detection using a method which will not require cooling of materials to attain high sensitivity .
The rapid advance in science today suggests many other avenues of investigation .
Our plan is to keep abreast of these advances , and select for development those fields which seem most promising for our special capabilities .
New plant facilities
Early in August we broke ground for a new $3,500,000 plant in Warwick , Rhode Island , which will house our textile and coil winding machinery operations .
Construction is well along , and the plant is scheduled for completion in November of this year .
All operations now carried on at our plant at Cranston will be transferred to Warwick .
Operations in the new plant should be producing efficiently early in 1962 .
An architect's sketch of the new plant is shown on the front cover .
The building will contain 430,000 square feet , approximately the same as our present plant .
However , its modern one-story layout is designed to increase our production capacity , permit more efficient manufacturing , and substantially reduce current repair and maintenance costs .
A major consideration in the choice of the Warwick site , four miles from Cranston , was the fact that it permits retention of our present trained and highly skilled work force .
We have entered into an agreement for the sale of the present Cranston properties , effective as soon as we have completed removal to our new plant .
British subsidiary
During the year our British subsidiary , Leesona-Holt , Limited , expanded its plant in Darwen , England , and added machine tool capacity .
The operations of its other plant in Rochdale and Leesona's former operations in Manchester were transferred to a recently acquired plant in the adjoining town of Heywood .
Layout and equipment were modernized and improved to obtain increased production on an efficient basis .
The area available at Heywood is approximately three times the size of the former Rochdale and Manchester locations .
In addition , land has been purchased to permit doubling the size of the plant in the future .
Financial developments
The new Warwick plant is being built at our expense and under our direction .
It will be transfered on completion to The Industrial Foundation of Rhode Island , a non-profit organization , which will reimburse us for the cost of construction .
We will then occupy the new plant under lease , with an option to purchase .
These arrangements are , in our opinion , very favorable to Leesona .
Interim financing of construction costs is provided by a short term loan from The Chase Manhattan Bank .
In addition to expenditures on the Warwick plant , we have invested approximately $1,961,000 for machinery and equipment at Cranston , and for new machinery , plant and equipment at Leesona-Holt , Limited .
We believe that these improved facilities will contribute income and effect savings which will fully justify the investment .
Long term loans have been reduced by $395,000 to $2,461,000 .
Inventories increased $625,561 to $8,313,514 during the year and should decline in coming months .
Thus we enter 1961 in a strong financial position .
Employee contracts
In accordance with the two-year contract signed in May , 1959 , with the International Association of Machinists , AFL-CIO , wages of hourly employees were increased by 4% in May , 1960 , and pay levels for non-exempt salaried employees were increased proportionately .
In addition , Blue Cross coverage for all employees and their dependents was extended to provide the full cost of semi-private hospital accommodations .
Personnel benefits
In addition to direct salaries and wages , the Company paid or accrued during the year the following amounts for the benefit of employees :
During the pension year ended December 31 , 1960 , 23 employees retired , making a total of 171 currently retired under the Company's pension plan .
At December 13 , 1960 the fund held by the Industrial National Bank of Providence , as trustee for payment of past and future service pensions to qualified members of the plan , totaled $2,412,616 .
The basic market for textiles is growing with the expansion of the population that began 20 years ago .
Another growth factor is increased consumer demand for better quality and larger quantities of fabrics that go with a rising standard of living .
As in many other industries , rising costs and intense competition , both domestic and foreign , have exerted increasing pressure on earnings of the textile industry in recent years .
Increased efficiency
In textiles , as elsewhere , a major part of the solution lies in greater efficiency and higher productivity .
As a designer and manufacturer of textile production machinery , Leesona and other companies in its industry have sought to meet this challenge with new or improved equipment and methods that would increase production , yet maintain both quality and flexibility .
Problems of shifting styles
The problem of efficient production in textiles is complicated by the fact that the industry serves large markets which shift quickly with changes of fashion in apparel or home decoration .
Production must be adjusted accordingly , at minimum cost and quickly .
In addition , production machinery must in many cases be designed to handle with equal efficiency both natural fibers and the increasing number of synthetics , as well as blends .
Following the term of service in Japan , each emissary returns for a brief visit to the campus to interpret his experience to the college community .
The Carleton Service Fund provides the financial support for this program .
Musical activities
the college was one of the first to recognize the importance of music not only as a definite part of the curriculum but as a vital adjunct to campus life .
Extensive facilities for group performance are provided by maintaining , under skilled direction , the Choir , the Orchestra , the Band , the Glee Club , and smaller ensembles of wind and string players .
All students are invited to participate in any of the musical organizations for which they qualify .
Orchestra , Band , and Choir have auditions during the week preceding the first day of classes .
The Glee Club is open to all students and faculty with no auditions necessary for membership .
In addition to the many appearances of these organizations throughout the college year , there are concerts by students of the music department , by members of the music faculty , and by visiting artists .
Student musical organizations are the Knights of Carleton and the Overtones ( men's vocal groups ) , and the Keynotes ( a women's singing group ) .
These student-directed organizations include eight to ten members each ; ;
they perform at many campus social events .
Religious activities
from the founding of the College those responsible for its management have planned to provide its students favorable conditions for personal religious development and to offer opportunities through the curriculum and otherwise for understanding the meaning and importance of religion .
Courses are offered in ethics , the philosophy and history of religion , Christian thought and history , and the Bible .
Carleton aims throughout its entire teaching program to represent a point of view and a spirit which will contribute to the moral and religious development of its students .
A college service of worship is held each Sunday morning at eleven o'clock in the Chapel .
The sermons are given by the College Chaplain , by members of the faculty , or by guest preachers .
Music is furnished by the Carleton College Choir .
Chapel services are held weekly .
These services at which attendance is voluntary are led by the Chaplain , by the President of the College , by selected faculty members , students , and visitors .
The service is brief and variety in forms of worship is practiced .
A Sunday evening program provides theological lectures , music , drama , and films related to the issues of the Judeo-Christian tradition .
Attendance is required at the College Service of Worship or at the Sunday Evening Program or at any regularly organized service of public worship .
Each semester every student must attend ten of the services or religious meetings .
Attendance at the Chapel Service is voluntary .
Religious organizations include the groups described below .
The Y.M.C.A. and Y.W.C.A. at Carleton are connected with the corresponding national organizations and carry out their general purposes .
Occasional meetings are held for the whole membership , usually with a guest speaker , while smaller discussion groups meet more frequently .
The Associations sponsor many traditional campus events and provide students with opportunities to form new friendships , to broaden their interests , and to engage in worthwhile service projects .
There are other organizations representing several of the denominational groups .
Included are the following : Baptist Student Movement , Canterbury Club ( Episcopal ) , Christian Science Organization , Friends' Meeting for Worship , Hillel ( Jewish ) , Liberal Religious Fellowship , Lutheran Student Association , Newman Club ( Roman Catholic ) , Presbyterian Student Fellowship , United Student Fellowship ( Congregational-Baptist ) , and Wesley Fellowship ( Methodist ) .
Student religious organizations are co-ordinated under the Religious Activities Committee , a standing committee of the Carleton Student Association .
The Northfield churches include the following : Alliance , Congregational-Baptist , Episcopal , Lutheran ( Norwegian , Danish , Missouri Synod , and Bethel ) , Methodist , Moravian , Pentecostal , and Roman Catholic .
Theater
the purpose of producing plays at the College is three-fold : to provide the Carleton students with the best possible opportunity for theater-going within the limits set by the maturity and experience of the performers and the theatrical facilities available ; ;
to encourage the practice of attending the theater ; ;
and to develop a discriminating audience for good drama and sensitive performance .
Dramatic activity at the College is organized and carried on by The Carleton Players , which is to say by all students who are so inclined to advance these aims .
For the 1960-1961 season , The Carleton Players have announced Blood Wedding by Federico Garcia Lorca , The Knight Of The Burning Pestle by Beaumont and Fletcher and A Moon For The Misbegotten by Eugene O'Neill , with a pre-season production of The Glass Menagerie by Tennessee Williams .
Student workshop
this workshop , located in Boliou Hall , provides facilities for students to work in ceramics , weaving , enameling , welding , woodworking , textile printing , printmaking , and lapidary .
These extra-curricular activities are conducted under supervision of the Director of the Student Workshop .
The workshop is open five afternoons and two evenings each week .
A student organization , Bottega , is open to any student interested in increasing his understanding and appreciation of the graphic and ceramic arts in their historical , technical , and productive contexts .
The group meets once a week in the Boliou Student Workshop .
They are assisted and advised by members of the Art Department .
Athletics
the Athletic program at Carleton is considered an integral part of the activities of the College and operates under the same budgetary procedure and controls as the academic work .
The physical education program for men recognizes the value of participation in competitive sports in the development of the individual student and aims to give every man an opportunity to enter some form of athletic competition , either intercollegiate or intramural .
The same standards for admission , for eligibility to receive scholarships or grants-in-aid , and for scholastic performance at college apply to all students .
A faculty committee on athletics , responsible to the faculty as a whole , exercises control over the athletic program of the College .
It concerns itself with : 1 .
The policies which govern the program 2 .
The preservation of desirable balance between the athletic and academic programs of the College 3 .
The approval of athletic schedules 4 .
The maintenance of Midwest Conference eligibility standards
Carleton is a member of the Midwest Collegiate Athletic Conference and abides by its eligibility rules .
In addition to these rules , Carleton has added the following : 1 .
A student who while in attendance at Carleton College participates in an athletic contest during the school year , other than that sponsored by the College , shall be permanently ineligible to participate in intercollegiate athletics at Carleton College and will also face permanent suspension from the institution .
The school year does not end for any student until he has completed his last examination of the semester .
2 .
A student to be eligible for the captaincy of any Carleton team must have a scholastic record of at least 1.00 .
The `` C '' club is composed of the men of the College who have won an official letter in Carleton athletics .
The purpose of the Club is to promote better athletic teams at Carleton and to increase interest in them among the student body .
This is done by encouraging the entire male student body to participate in either the intercollegiate or intramural sports program and by sponsoring the Carleton cheerleaders .
Soccer Club .
The Soccer Club was organized by undergraduate men interested in playing soccer and promoting the sport .
Membership consists of both beginners and experienced players .
Practices are held regularly and the schedule of games is prepared by the student coach and the officers of the club .
Women's Recreation Association .
This Association , organized in 1920 , is affiliated with the Athletic Federation of College Women .
The purpose of the organization is to further the interest of women students in recreational activities as a means of promoting physical efficiency , sportsmanship , and `` play for play's sake '' .
The Association is governed by a board made up of representatives from each of the four classes .
Membership is open to any woman student in the College .
Active groups sponsored by the organization include the Saddle Club , Orchesis , Golf Club , Tennis Club , and Dolphins .
The Saddle Club , open to students proficient in horsemanship , presents the Annual Spring Riding Exhibition , and during the year it offers speakers , movies , breakfast rides , and trips to broaden their knowledge of the sport .
Orchesis , for students interested in the modern dance , contributes to the May Fete and offers earlier in the year a modern dance demonstration .
Tennis Club participates in a dual tennis tournament with the University of Minnesota each fall , and also sponsors a two-day state invitational tennis meet at Carleton in May .
The Dolphins present a three-night water show the week of the May Fete .
Under the auspices of the Women's Recreation Association , interclass competition is organized in badminton , basketball , field hockey , golf , tennis , and swimming .
The Association participates in the winter sports carnival and sponsors several Play Days with St. Olaf and other nearby colleges .
With the co-operation of the Department of Physical Education for Men , the Women's Recreation Association arranges mixed tournaments in tennis and golf in the fall and spring .
Throughout the year there are social events , such as picnics , breakfast hikes , canoe trips , banquets , and indoor parties .
College publications
in addition to the miscellaneous pamphlets and other printed matter which it issues , the College maintains regular publications , as follows :
The Bulletin , in five issues : The Report Of The President in August ; ;
The Alumni Fund Report in September ; ;
the Annual Catalog in March ; ;
an Alumni Reunion Bulletin in April ; ;
and a special Bulletin in June .
The College also publishes each year The Report Of The Treasurer and a monthly newsletter entitled Carleton College Comments .
In co-operation with the Alumni Association of Carleton College , an alumni magazine , The Voice Of The Carleton Alumni , is edited and mailed seven times a year by the College's Publications Office and the Alumni Office .
At intervals an alumni directory is issued .
These publications may be secured as follows : The Annual Catalog from the Director of Admissions and other issues from the Publications Office .
In January , 1960 , the first issue of The Carleton Miscellany , a quarterly literary magazine , was published by the College .
The magazine , edited by members of the Carleton Department of English , includes contributions by authors from both within and beyond the Carleton community .
Student publications
The Carletonian , the college newspaper , is edited by students and published by the College under the supervision of the Publications Board .
( See page 100 .
) It is issued weekly throughout the college year .
The Publications Board holds annual competitive examinations for places on the editorial and business staffs .
The editor , sports editor , and student business manager are chosen in December , the new staff assuming responsibility for the paper at the beginning of the second semester .
The paper affords excellent practice for students interested in the field of journalism .
The Algol , the college annual , is published in the fall of each year .
The Algol serves as a record of campus organizations and student activities during the year .
The Publications Board receives applications for the positions of editor and business manager and makes the appointments in the spring previous to the year of publication .
Members of The Algol staff are nominated by the editor and business manager and appointed by the Publications Board .
Manuscript , a quarterly literary magazine , is published by the students of the College .
It is the purpose of this magazine to serve as an outlet for student creative writing .
The editor and business manager of Manuscript are appointed by the Publications Board .
Campus broadcasting station
A low-power , `` carrier-current '' broadcasting station , KARL , heard only in the campus dormitories , is owned and operated by the students to provide an outlet for student dramatic , musical , literary , technical , and other talents , and to furnish information , music , and entertainment for campus listeners .
Over a hundred students participate in the planning and production of the daily program schedule .
KARL provides experience for students who wish to pursue careers in radio .
Student government
the Carleton Student Association includes all students in college and is intended `` to work for the betterment of Carleton College by providing student government and student participation with the college administration in the formulation and execution of policies which pertain to student life and activities '' .
The Carleton Social Co-operative is a standing committee of the Carleton Student Association .
Week-end activities for the entire campus are planned by the Co-op Board .
In recent months , much attention has been given to the probable extent of the current downtrend in business and economists are somewhat divided as to the outlook for the near future .
And yet , despite some disappointment with the performance of this first year of the new decade , 1960 has been a good year in many ways , with many overall measures of business having reached new peaks for the year as a whole .
The shift in sentiment from excessive optimism early in the year to the present mood of caution has probably been a good thing , in that it has prevented the accumulation of the burdensome inventories that have characterized many previous swings in the business cycle .
This caution has been particularly noticeable in a tendency of retailers and distributors to shift the inventory burden back on the supplier , and the fact stocks at retail are low in many lines has escaped attention because of the presence of higher stocks at the manufacturing level .
In the electronics industry , this tendency is well illustrated by inventories of TV sets .
Factory stocks in recent months have been the highest they have been in three years , while those at retail are below 1959 .
The total value of our industry's shipments , at factory prices , increased from $9.2 billion in 1959 to approximately $10.1 billion as a result of increases in all of the major segments of our business -- home entertainment , military , industrial , and replacement .
I believe a further gain is in prospect for 1961 .
Home entertainment sales up
Reflecting the largest percentage of high-end sets such as consoles and combinations since 1953 , dollar value of home entertainment electronics in 1960 was about $1.9 billion , compared to $1.7 billion in 1959 .
Sales of TV sets at retail ran ahead of the like months of 1959 through July ; ;
set production ( excluding those destined for the export market ) also ran ahead in the early months , but was curtailed after the usual vacation shutdowns in the face of growing evidence that some of the early production plans had been overly optimistic .
For the year as a whole , retail sales of TV sets probably came to 5.8 million against 5.7 million in 1959 ; ;
however , production came to only 5.6 million compared to 6.2 million .
In contrast to the lower turnout of TV , total radio production increased from 15.4 million sets to 16.7 million ( excluding export ) .
Both home and auto radios were in excellent demand , with retail sales of home sets ahead of 1959 in every month of the first eleven ; ;
sales and production of home sets were about equal at 10.4 million units .
Auto set production came to about 6.3 million compared to 5.6 million in 1959 .
Separate phonographs also had a good year , reflecting the growing popularity of stereo sound and the same tendency on the part of the consumer to upgrade that characterized the radio-TV market .
The outlook for entertainment electronics in 1961 is certainly far from clear at present , but recent surveys have shown a desire on the part of consumers to step up their buying plans for durable goods .
I would expect that sales at retail in the first half of 1961 might be below 1960 by some 10 - 15% but that second-half levels should show a favorable comparison , with a possibility of quite strong demand late in the year if business conditions recover as some recent forecasts suggest they will .
I look for TV sales and production to be approximately equal at 5.7 million sets for the year , but I look for some decline in radios from the high rate in 1961 to more nearly the 1959 level of 15.0 - 15.5 million sets .
I therefore believe it is realistic to assume a modest drop in the total value of home entertainment electronics to about $1.8 million , slightly below 1960 , but above 1959 .
Military electronics to grow
1960 witnessed another substantial increase in our industry's shipments of military electronics , which totalled about $5.4 billion compared to $4.9 billion in 1959 .
It is interesting to note that the present level of military electronics procurement is greater than the industry's total sales to all markets in 1950-1953 , which were good years for our industry with television enjoying its initial period of rapid consumer acceptance .
It has been correctly pointed out by well-informed people in the industry that it is probably unrealistic to expect a continuation of the yearly growth of 15% or better that characterized the decade of the 1950's , and that our military markets may be entering upon a new phase in which procurement of multiple weapons systems will give way to concentration of still undeveloped areas of our defense capability .
While this may well be true in general , I believe it is also important to keep in mind that some recent developments suggest that over the next year or so military electronics may be one of the most strongly growing areas in an economy which is not expanding rapidly in other directions .
Among the items scheduled for acceleration in the near future are the Polaris and B70 programs , strengthening of the airborne alert system of the Strategic Air Command , and improved battlefield surveillance systems .
Research and development expenditures connected with the reconnaissance satellite SAMOS and the future development of ballistic missile defense systems such as Nike-Zeus are expected to increase substantially .
Research , development test and evaluation funds , devoted to missiles in 1960 were 3 to 4 times as large as those devoted to aircraft , and actual missile procurement is expected to exceed aircraft procurement by 1963 .
Still later , the realm of space technology will show substantial gains ; ;
it has been estimated that spending by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration will rise from less than $500 million in fiscal 1960 to more than $2 billion by 1967 , and that the electronic industry's share of these expenditures will be closer to 50% than the current 20% .
The stepped-up defense procurement called for in the 1961 Budget has already begun to make itself felt in an upturn in orders for military electronic equipment and the components that go into it , and it has been suggested that an additional $2 billion increase in total defense spending may be requested for fiscal 1962 .
Although the impact of these increases on our industry's shipments will be gradual , on balance I look for another good increase in shipments in the coming year , to at least $6 billion .
Industrial electronic equipment
Paced by the continuing rapid growth of electronic data processing , sales of industrial and commercial electronic equipment totalled $1.8 billion compared to $1.6 billion in 1959 .
The market for computers and other data-handling continues to expand at the rate of about 30% annually , reaching some $450 million in 1960 .
Informed estimates look for this market to approximately quadruple by the late 1960's , under the stimulus of new applications in the fields of banking and retailing , industrial process control , and information storage and retrieval .
In the industrial field , prospects for higher expenditures on electronic testing and measuring equipment are also quite bright .
For the near term , however , it must be realized that the industrial and commercial market is somewhat more sensitive to general business conditions than is the military market , and for this reason I would expect that any gain in 1961 may be somewhat smaller than those of recent years ; ;
sales should slightly exceed 1960 , however , and reach $1.9 billion .
Replacement parts
In addition to the three major original equipment segments of the electronics business , the steady growth in the market for replacement parts continues year by year .
This is now a $1.0 billion business , up from $0.9 billion in 1959 , and should reach $1.1 billion in 1961 .
The markets for electronic parts in 1960 have reflected the changing patterns of the various end equipment segments of the industry .
Demand for parts for home entertainment was strong in the first half , but purchases were cut back to lower levels during the fall as set manufacturers reduced their own operating rates .
In the military field , incoming orders turned down early in the year , and remained rather slow until late fall when the upturn in procurement of equipment began to make itself felt in rising orders for components .
Sales of transistors in 1960 exceeded $300 million , compared to $222 million in 1959 despite substantial price reductions in virtually all types .
Production totalled about 123 million units against 82 million in 1959 , and I look for a further gain to 188 million units worth approximately $380 million in 1961 .
Sales of passive components , such as capacitors and resistors , although not growing as fast as those of semi-conductors were ahead of 1959 this year , and should increase again in 1961 .
In sum , I look for another good year for the electronics industry in 1961 , with total sales increasing about 7% to $10.8 billion , despite the uncertainties in the business outlook generally .
As I have indicated above , I base this feeling on a belief that current weakness in the market for consumer durable goods may continue through the early months of the year , but will give way to a sufficiently strong recovery later on to bring the full-year figures close to those of 1960 ; ;
on prospects for continued increases in defense spending ; ;
and on continued growth in the applications of electronics to the complex problems of manufacturing and trade in the expanding but competitive economy of the 1960's .

Mr. Brown , well-known , English-born inventor , prior to founding VecTrol was at various times section leader in radio research at Metropolitan Vickers Electrical Co. , Ltd. ; ;
chief engineer of the radio set division of Electric and Musical Industries , Ltd. , the largest electronic equipment manufacturer in Great Britain ; ;
director of engineering at Philco of Great Britain , Ltd. , and vice president in charge of production and assistant to the president at The Brush Development Co. , Cleveland , Ohio .
He has a Bachelor of Science from the University of Manchester , England .
Mr. Brown presently has over 130 patents to his credit dating back to 1923 .
He is a fellow of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers , and a senior member of the Institute of Radio Engineers .
He is a member of the Institution of Electrical Engineers , London , a registered professional engineer in Connecticut and Ohio , and a chartered electrical engineer in Great Britain .
The promotion of Robert E. Swift to the position of Assistant Manager of the Interference Control Field Service Department was announced early in December by Frederick S. Scarborough , Manager of Interference Control Field Service .
The appointment was made in a move to expand the engineering services offered to the designers of electronic systems through assistance in electro-magnetic compatability problems .
Between meetings he helps the president keep track of delegated matters .
Since these duties fit neatly with those of the proposed presidential aide , one person , with adequate staff assistance , could fill both jobs .
Since faculty see themselves as self-employed professionals rather than as employees , enthusiasm in a common enterprise is proportionate to the sense of ownership they have in it by virtue of sharing in the decisions that govern its course .
The faculty believes that broad autonomy is necessary to preserve its freedom in teaching and scholarship .
The president expects faculty members to remember , in exercising their autonomy , that they share no collective responsibility for the university's income nor are they personally accountable for top-level decisions .
He may welcome their appropriate participation in the determination of high policy , but he has a right to expect , in return , that they will leave administrative matters to the administration .
How well do faculty members govern themselves ? ?
There is little evidence that they are giving any systematic thought to a general theory of the optimum scope and nature of their part in government .
They sometimes pay more attention to their rights than to their own internal problems of government .
They , too , need to learn to delegate .
Letting the administration take details off their hands would give them more time to inform themselves about education as a whole , an area that would benefit by more faculty attention .
Although faculties insist on governing themselves , they grant little prestige to a member who actively participates in college or university government .
There are , nevertheless , several things that the president can do to stimulate participation and to enhance the prestige of those who are willing to exercise their privilege .
He can , for example , present significant university-wide issues to the senate .
He can encourage quality in faculty committee work in various ways : by seeing to it that the membership of each committee represents the thoughtful as well as the action-oriented faculty ; ;
by making certain that no faculty member has too many committee assignments ; ;
by assuring good liaison between the committees and the administration ; ;
by minimizing the number of committees .
Despite the many avenues for the exchange of ideas between faculty and administration , complaints of a lack of communication persist .
The cause is as often neglect as hesitance to disclose .
A busy president , conversant with a problem and its ramifications and beset by pressures to meet deadlines , tends naturally to assume that others must be as familiar with a problem as he is .
The need for interchange and understanding makes vital the full use of all methods of consultation .
To increase faculty influence and decrease tension , many presidents have established a standing advisory committee with which they can discuss problems frankly .
The president has little influence in day-by-day curricular changes , but if he looks ahead two , three , or five years to anticipate issues and throw out challenging ideas , he can open the way for innovation , and he can also have a great deal to say as to what path it will take .
Success will require tact , sensitivity to faculty prerogatives , patience , and persistence .
The critical task for every president and his academic administrative staff is to assure that the college or university continually rebuilds and regenerates itself so that its performance will match changing social demands .
Great professors do not automatically reproduce themselves .
Deans can form an important bridge between the president and the faculty .
They serve not only as spokesmen for their areas , but they also contribute to top-level decision making .
The president who appoints strong men who have an all-college or university point of view and a talent and respect for administration can count on useful assistance .
Faculty members depend on their department chairmen to promote their interests with the administration .
The administration at the same time , looks to the chairmen for strategic aid in building stronger departments .
One way that this can be done , other than by hiring new high-priced professors , is by constantly encouraging the department members to raise their standards of performance .
The quality of a president's leadership is measured first by his success in building up the faculty .
By supporting the efforts of the many faculty members who are working to attain ever higher standards , the president can encourage faculty leadership .
Indirectly he can best help them by insuring that rigorous criteria for appointment and promotion are clearly set forth and adhered to .
The academic dean should take a direct , long-term interest in faculty development .
An alert dean will confer all through the year on personnel needs , plans for the future , qualifications of those on the job , and bright prospects elsewhere .
For the maintenance of a long-term program , the departments , and particularly their chairmen , are strategic .
They evaluate and nominate candidates for appointment and promotion .
To provide an independent judgment for the president , the academic dean also investigates candidates thoroughly .
At some colleges and universities , a faculty committee reviews and reports to the administration on the qualifications of candidates .
Some faculty members and many administrators oppose faculty review groups because they either repeat department's actions or act pro forma .
They can be effective , however , if their members set high standards for candidates and devote substantial time to the work .
At one university , the president cites the faculty review committee as `` a valued partner of the administration in guarding and promoting the quality of the faculty '' .
Before the president recommends a candidate to the trustees , the administration collects the views of colleagues in the same field of knowledge on campus and elsewhere .
The president or dean reads some of his publications to form the truest possible evaluation of the quality of his mind .
No good way to evaluate teaching ability has yet been discovered , although some institutions use inventory sheets for a list of criteria .
To avoid passing over quiet , unaggressive teachers as well as to decide whether others merit promotion , review of the right of faculty members to promotion or salary increases should be made periodically whether or not they have been recommended for advancement by their departments .
There are certain aspects of personnel development in which a president must involve himself directly .
He should personally consider the potential of a faculty member proposed for tenure , to guard against the mistake of making this profoundly serious commitment turn solely upon the man's former achievements .
No one can be as effective as the president in inspiring older men to welcome imaginative new teachers whose philosophy or approach to their specialties is quite different .
In particular , the president may have to summon all his oratorical powers to persuade department members to accept an outstanding man above the normal salary scale .
On those rare occasions when a faculty member on tenure is not meeting the standards of the institution , the president must also bear the ultimate burden of decision and action .
A true university , like most successful marriages , is a unity of diversities Without forcing all components into a single pattern , the preparation of a master plan is an opportunity to consider interrelation of knowledge at its highest level , which a university -- in contrast to a multiversity -- should stand for .
Recently colleges and universities have begun to translate their educational philosophy into institution-wide goals .
Each year a few more institutions are deciding such questions as : Shall we require a liberal education built around a humanities core for all undergraduates ? ?
Or shall we permit early specialization in scientific and technological subjects ? ?
In the first instance , adequate appropriate reading materials and library accommodations must be planned .
In the second , more shops , laboratories , and staff will be required .
For the president , a master plan looking ahead five years ( the maximum reach for sound forecasting ) , offers several practical advantages .
Trustees , faculty , and administration can consider the consequences of decisions before they are made , instead of afterwards .
Physical plant and equipment can be efficiently developed .
Proposed new programs can be examined for appropriateness to goals and for present and future financial fitness .
More than one president has found that a long-range plan helps him to attract major gifts .
It inspires confidence in his institution's determination to establish goals and to achieve them .
Before deciding where it is going , however , a college or university must know where it is .
The first step is a comprehensive self study made by faculty , by outside consultants , or by a combination of the two .
It should sternly appraise curricula , faculty , organization , buildings , faculty work loads , and potential for growth in stature and size .
Implementation of the master plan will inevitably be uneven .
Some departments will attack their new goals enthusiastically ; ;
others may drag their feet .
Funds may be readily donated for some purposes but not others .
A plan must therefore be brought up to date periodically , possibly with the assistance of a permanent planning officer .
To provide the continuous flow of information basic to administrative decisions , a number of institutions have established offices of institutional research .
Some offices have very broad responsibilities , touching on almost all aspects of a university's instructional program .
Their duties include evaluation of the information collected and preparation of recommendations .
More often , these offices are restricted to the gathering of empirical data .
The president's opportunity for influencing education reaches its highest point , as he decides which projects he will cut back , which he will advance by increased allowances or new fund-raising efforts .
No matter how high the hopes and dreams of educators , budget making adjusts them to the cold realities of dollars and cents .
When the budget goes to trustees for approval it is the president's budget , to which his faith and credit are committed ; ;
its principal features should be a product of his most considered judgment .
He cannot , of course , examine each proposal from scratch .
He reviews and shapes the work of others to mold a single joint product that will best promote the aims of the institution .
Budgeting must be flexible to allow adaptation to the rapid changes in scientific and technological scholarship .
Because scientific instruction and research involve increasingly large sums of money , an institution should choose its fields of prominence .
Otherwise it will be headed for bankruptcy , at worst , and at best towards starvation of other less dramatic but socially and culturally indispensable branches of learning .
In the national interest even the affluent universities must consider some division of labor among them to replace their present ambitions to keep up with the Joneses in all branches .
Supporting activities -- business management , public relations , fund-raising -- offer presidents one of their best chances to buy freedom for attention to education .
Here the reasonable mastery of the elements of administration can do much to free a president for his primary role .
In the areas that do not relate directly to the educational program , expert subordinates will serve the college or university better than close presidential attention .
The president should find strong subordinates and delegate the widest discretion to them .
Higher education cannot compete with the salary scales of the business world , but an educational institution can offer many potent intangible attractions to members of the business community that will offset the differences in income .
Just as the entire faculty should know the president's educational philosophy and objectives , so should non-academic officers .
They will better understand the relationship of their activities to the academic program and they will be able to explain their actions to faculty in terms of mutual goals .
A president is frequently besieged to serve in non-academic civic and governmental capacities , to make speeches to lay groups , and to make numerous ceremonial appearances on and off campus .
Since he can neither accept nor reject them all , he must be governed by the time and energy available for his prime professional obligations .
Declinations and substitutions are better received when he explains why his obligations to his institution preclude his acceptance .
By sharing the load of important speeches with his colleagues , the president can develop a cadre of able spokesmen who will help to create a public perception of the university as an institution , something more than the lengthened shadow of one man .

Introduction
It has recently become practical to use the radio emission of the moon and planets as a new source of information about these bodies and their atmospheres .
The results of present observations of the thermal radio emission of the moon are consistent with the very low thermal conductivity of the surface layer which was derived from the variation in the infrared emission during eclipses ( e.g. , Garstung , 1958 ) .
When sufficiently accurate and complete measurements are available , it will be possible to set limits on the thermal and electrical characteristics of the surface and subsurface materials of the moon .
Observations of the radio emission of a planet which has an extensive atmosphere will probe the atmosphere to a greater extent than those using shorter wave lengths and should in some cases give otherwise unobtainable information about the characteristics of the solid surface .
Radio observations of Venus and Jupiter have already supplied unexpected experimental data on the physical conditions of these planets .
The observed intensity of the radio emission of Venus is much higher than the expected thermal intensity , although the spectrum indicated by measurements at wave lengths near 3 cm and 10 cm is like that of a black body at about 600-degrees .
This result suggests a very high temperature at the solid surface of the planet , although there is the possibility that the observed radiation may be a combination of both thermal and non-thermal components and that the observed spectrum is that of a black body merely by coincidence .
For the case of Jupiter , the radio emission spectrum is definitely not like the spectrum of a black-body radiator , and it seems very likely that the radiation reaching the earth is a combination of thermal radiation from the atmosphere and non-thermal components .
Of the remaining planets , only Mars and Saturn have been observed as radio sources , and not very much information is available .
Mars has been observed twice at about 3-cm wave length , and the intensity of the observed radiation is in reasonable agreement with the thermal radiation which might be predicted on the basis of the known temperature of Mars .
The low intensity of the radiation from Saturn has limited observations , but again the measured radiation seems to be consistent with a thermal origin .
No attempts to measure the radio emission of the remaining planets have been reported , and , because of their distances , small diameters , or low temperatures , the thermal radiation at radio wave lengths reaching the earth from these sources is expected to be of very low intensity .
In spite of this , the very large radio reflectors and improved amplifying techniques which are now becoming available should make it possible to observe the radio emission of most of the planets in a few years .
The study of the radio emission of the moon and planets began with the detection of the thermal radiation of the moon at 1.25-cm wave length by Dicke and Beringer ( 1946 ) .
This was followed by a comprehensive series of observations of the 1.25-cm emission of the moon over three lunar cycles by Piddington and Minnett ( 1949 ) .
They deduced from their measurements that the radio emission from the whole disk of the moon varied during a lunation in a roughly sinusoidal fashion ; ;
that the amplitude of the variation was considerably less than the amplitude of the variation in the infrared emission as measured by Pettit and Nicholson ( 1930 ) and Pettit ( 1935 ) ; ;
and that the maximum of the radio emission came about 3-1/2 days after Full Moon , which is again in contrast to the infrared emission , which reaches its maximum at Full Moon .
Piddington and Minnett explained their observations by pointing out that rocklike materials which are likely to make up the surface of the moon would be partially transparent to radio waves , although opaque to infrared radiation .
The infrared emission could then be assumed to originate at the surface of the moon , while the radio emission originates at some depth beneath the surface , where the temperature variation due to solar radiation is reduced in amplitude and shifted in phase .
Since the absorption of radio waves in rocklike material varies with wave length , it should be possible to sample the temperature variation at different depths beneath the surface and possibly detect changes in the structure or composition of the lunar surface material .
The radio emission of a planet was first detected in 1955 , when Burke and Franklin ( 1955 ) identified the origin of interference-like radio noise on their records at about 15 meters wave length as emission from Jupiter .
This sporadic type of planetary radiation is discussed by Burke ( chap. 13 ) and Gallet ( chap. 14 ) .
Steady radiation which was presumably of thermal origin was observed from Venus at 3.15 and 9.4 cm , and from Mars and Jupiter at 3.15 cm in 1956 ( Mayer , McCullough , and Sloanaker , 1958 , A , B , C ) , and from Saturn at 3.75 cm in 1957 ( Drake and Ewen , 1958 ) .
In the relatively short time since these early observations , Venus has been observed at additional wave lengths in the range from 0.8 to 10.2 cm , and Jupiter has been observed over the wave-length range from 3.03 to 68 Aj .
The observable characteristics of planetary radio radiation are the intensity , the polarization , and the direction of arrival of the waves .
The maximum angular diameter of any planetary disk as observed from the earth is about 1 minute of arc .
This is much smaller than the highest resolution of even the very large reflectors now under construction , and consequently the radio emission of different regions of the disk cannot be resolved .
It should be possible , however , to put useful limits on the diameters of the radio sources by observing with large reflectors or with interferometers .
Measurements of polarization are presently limited by apparatus sensitivity and will remain difficult because of the low intensity of the planetary radiation at the earth .
There have been few measurements specifically for the determination of the polarization of planetary radiation .
The measurements made with the NRL 50-foot reflector , which is altitude-azimuth-mounted , would have shown a systematic change with local hour angle in the measured intensities of Venus and Jupiter if a substantial part of the radiation had been linearly polarized .
Recent interferometer measurements ( Radhakrishnan and Roberts , 1960 ) have shown the 960-mc emission of Jupiter to be partially polarized and to originate in a region of larger diameter than the visible disk .
Other than this very significant result , most of the information now available about the radio emission of the planets is restricted to the intensity of the radiation .
The concept of apparent black-body temperature is used to describe the radiation received from the moon and the planets .
The received radiation is compared with the radiation from a hypothetical black body which subtends the same solid angle as the visible disk of the planet .
The apparent black-body disk temperature is the temperature which must be assumed for the black body in order that the intensity of its radiation should equal that of the observed radiation .
The use of this concept does not specify the origin of the radiation , and only if the planet really radiates as a black body , will the apparent black-body temperature correspond to the physical temperature of the emitting material .
The radio radiation of the sun which is reflected from the moon and planets should be negligible compared with their thermal emission at centimeter wave lengths , except possibly at times of exceptional outbursts of solar radio noise .
The quiescent level of centimeter wave-length solar radiation would increase the average disk brightness temperature by less than 1-degree .
At meter wave lengths an increase of the order of 10-degrees in the average disk temperatures of the nearer planets would be expected .
Therefore , neglecting the extreme outbursts , reflected solar radiation is not expected to cause sizable errors in the measurements of planetary radiation in the centimeter- and decimeter-wave-length range .

The moon
2.1 observations
Radio observations of the moon have been made over the range of wave lengths from 4.3 mm to 75 cm , and the results are summarized in Table 1 .
Observations have also been made at 1.5 mm using optical techniques ( Sinton , 1955 , 1956 , ; ;
see also chap. 11 ) .
Not all the observers have used the same procedures or made the same assumptions about the lunar brightness distribution when reducing the data , and this , together with differences in the methods of calibrating the antennae and receivers , must account for much of the disagreement in the measured radio brightness temperatures .
In the observations at 4.3 mm ( Coates , 1959 ) , the diameter of the antenna beam , 6'.7 , was small enough to allow resolution of some of the larger features of the lunar surface , and contour diagrams have been made of the lunar brightness distribution at three lunar phases .
These observations indicate that the lunar maria heat up more rapidly and also cool off more rapidly than do the mountainous regions .
Mare Imbrium seems to be an exception and remains cooler than the regions which surround it .
These contour diagrams also suggest a rather rapid falloff in the radio brightness with latitude .
Very recently , observations have been made at 8-mm wave length with a reflector 22 meters in diameter with a resultant beam width of only about 2' ( Amenitskii , Noskova , and Salomonovich , 1960 ) .
The constant-temperature contours are much smoother than those observed at 4.3 mm by Coates ( 1959 ) and apparently the emission at 8 mm is not nearly so sensitive to differences in surface features .
Such high-resolution observations as these are needed at several wave lengths in order that the radio emission of the moon can be properly interpreted .
The observations of Mayer , McCullough , and Sloanaker at 3.15 cm and of Sloanaker at 10.3 cm have not previously been published and will be briefly described .
Measurements at 3.15 cm were obtained on 11 days spread over the interval May 3 to June 19 , 1956 , using the 50-foot reflector at the U. S. Naval Research Laboratory in Washington .
The half-intensity diameter of the antenna beam was about 9' , and the angle subtended by the moon included the entire main beam and part of the first side lobes .
The antenna patterns and the power gain at the peak of the beam were both measured ( Mayer , McCullough , and Sloanaker , 1958 ) , so that the absolute power sensitivity of the antenna beam over the solid angle of the moon was known .
The ratio of the measured antenna temperature change during a drift scan across the moon to the average brightness temperature of the moon over the antenna beam ( assuming that the brightness temperature of the sky is negligible ) was found , by graphical integration of the antenna directivity diagram , to be 0.85 .
The measured brightness temperature is a good approximation to the brightness temperature at the center of the lunar disk because of the narrow antenna beam and because the temperature distribution over the central portion of the moon's disk is nearly uniform .
The result of the observations is Af where the phase angle , Q , is measured in degrees from new moon and the probable errors include absolute as well as relative errors .
This result is plotted along with the 8.6-mm observations of Gibson ( 1958 ) in figure 1 , A .
The variation in the 3-cm emission of the moon during a lunation is very much less than the variation in the 8.6-mm emission , as would be expected from the explanation of Piddington and Minnett ( 1949 ) .
In the discussion which follows , the time average of the radio emission will be referred to as the constant component , and the superimposed periodic variation will be called the variable component .
The 10.3-cm observation of Sloanaker was made on May 20 , 1958 , using the 84-foot reflector at the Maryland Point Observatory of the U. S. Naval Research Laboratory .
The age of the moon was about 2 days .
The half-intensity diameter of the main lobe of the antenna was about 18'.5 , and the brightness temperature was reduced by assuming a Gaussian shape for the antenna beam and a uniformly bright disk for the moon .
Abstract
Experiments were made on an electric arc applying a porous graphite anode cooled by a transpiring gas ( Argon ) .
Thus , the energy transferred from the arc to the anode was partly fed back into the arc .
It was shown that by proper anode design the net energy loss of the arc to the anode could be reduced to approximately 15% of the total arc energy .
A detailed energy balance of the anode was established .
The anode ablation could be reduced to a negligible amount .
The dependence of the arc voltage upon the mass flow velocity of the transpirating gas was investigated for various arc lengths and currents between 100 Amp and 200 Aj .
Qualitative observations were made and high-speed motion pictures were taken to study flow phenomena in the arc at various mass flow velocities .
Introduction
The high heat fluxes existing at the electrode surfaces of electric arcs necessitate extensive cooling to prevent electrode ablation .
The cooling requirements are particularly severe at the anode .
In free-burning electric arcs , for instance , approximately 90% of the total arc power is transferred to the anode giving rise to local heat fluxes in excess of Af as measured by the authors -- the exact value depending on the arc atmosphere .
In plasma generators as currently commercially available for industrial use or as high temperature research tools often more than 50% of the total energy input is being transferred to the cooling medium of the anode .
The higher heat transfer rates at the anode compared with those at the cathode can be explained by the physical phenomena occurring in free burning arcs .
In plasma generators the superimposed forced convection may modify the picture somewhat .
The heat transfer to the anode is due to the following effects : 1 .
Heat of condensation ( work function ) plus kinetic energy of the electrons impinging on the anode .
This energy transfer depends on the current , the temperature in the arc column , the anode material , and the conditions in the anode sheath .
2 .
Heat transfer by molecular conduction as well as by radiation from the arc column .
The heat transfer to the anode in free burning arcs is enhanced by a hot gas jet flowing from the cathode towards the anode with velocities up Af .
This phenomenon has been experimentally investigated in detail by Maecker ( Ref. 1 ) .
The pressure gradient producing the jet is due to the nature of the magnetic field in the arc ( rapid decrease of current density from cathode to the anode ) .
Hence , the flow conditions at the anode of free burning arcs resemble those near a stagnation point .
It is apparent from the above and from experimental evidence that the cooling requirements for the anode of free burning arcs are large compared with those for the cathode .
The gas flow through a plasma generator will modify these conditions ; ;
however , the anode is still the part receiving the largest heat flux .
An attempt to improve the life of the anodes or the efficiency of the plasma generators must , therefore , aim at a reduction of the anode loss .
The following possibilities exist for achieving this : 1 .
The use of high voltages and low currents by proper design to reduce electron heat transfer to the anode for a given power output .
2 .
Continuous motion of the arc contact area at the anode by flow or magnetic forces .
3 .
Feedback of the energy transferred to the anode by applying gas transpiration through the anode .
The third method was , to our knowledge , successfully applied for the first time by C. Sheer and co-workers ( Ref. 2 ) .
The purpose of the present study is to study the thermal conditions and to establish an energy balance for a transpiration cooled anode as well as the effect of blowing on the arc voltage .
Gas injection through a porous anode ( transpiration cooling ) not only feeds back the energy transferred to the anode by the above mentioned processes , but also modifies the conditions in the arc itself .
A detailed study of this latter phenomenon was not attempted in this paper .
Argon was used as a blowing gas to exclude any effects of dissociation or chemical reaction .
The anode material was porous graphite .
Sintered porous metals should be usable in principle .
However , technical difficulties arise by melting at local hot spots .
The experimental arrangement as described below is based on the geometry of free burning arcs .
Thus , direct comparisons can be drawn with free burning arcs which have been studied in detail during the past years and decades by numerous investigators ( Ref. 3 ) .
Experimental apparatus
Figures 1 to 3 show photographic and schematic views of the test stand and of two different models of the anode holder .
The cathode consisted of a 1/4'' '' diameter thoriated tungsten rod attached to a water cooled copper tube .
This tube could be adjusted in its axial direction by an electric drive to establish the required electrode spacing .
The anode in figure 2 was mounted by means of the anode holder which was attached to a steel plug and disk .
The transpiring gas ejected from the anode formed a jet directed axially towards the cathode below .
Inflow of air from the surrounding atmosphere was prevented by the two disks shown in figure 2 .
Argon was also blown at low velocities ( mass flow rate Af ) through a tube coaxial with the cathode as an additional precaution against contamination of the arc by air .
The anode consisted of a 1/2 inch diameter porous graphite plug , 1/4 inch long .
The graphite was National Carbon NC 60 , which has a porosity of 50% and an average pore size of 30 .
This small pore size was required to ensure uniformity of the flow leaving the anode .
The anode plug ( Figure 2 ) was inserted into a carbon anode holder .
A shielded thermocouple was used to measure the upstream temperature of the transpiring gas .
It was exposed to a high velocity gas jet .
A plug and a tube with holes in its cylindrical walls divided the chamber above the porous plug into two parts .
This arrangement had the purpose to prevent heated gas to reach the thermocouple by natural convection .
Two pyrometers shown in figure 1 and 2 ( Pyrometer Instrument Co. Model 95 ) served for simultaneous measurement of the anode surface temperature and the temperature distribution along the anode holder .
Three thermocouples were placed at different locations in the aluminum disk surrounding the anode holder to determine its temperature .
Another anode holder used in the experiments is shown in figure 3 .
In this design the anode holder is water cooled and the heat losses by conduction from the anode were determined by measuring the temperature rise of the coolant .
To reduce heat transfer from the hot gas to this anode holder outside the regime of the arc , a carbon shield was attached to the surface providing an air gap of 1/16 inch between the plate and the surface of the anode holder .
In addition , the inner surface of the carbon shield was covered with aluminum foil to reduce radiation .
Temperatures of the shield and of the surface of the water-cooled anode holder were measured by thermocouples to account for heat received by the coolant but not originating from the anode plug .
The argon flow from commercial bottles was regulated by a pressure regulator and measured with a gas flow rator .
The power source was a commercial D. C. rectifier .
At 100 Amp the 360 cycle ripple was less than 0.5 V ( peak to peak ) with a resistive load .
The current was regulated by means of a variable resistor and measured with a 50 mV shunt and millivoltmeter .
The arc voltage was measured with a voltmeter whose terminals were connected to the anode and cathode holders .
Because of the falling characteristic of the rectifier , no ballast resistor was required for stability of operation .
A high frequency starter was used to start the arc .
Experimental procedure and error analysis
1 .
Transpiration cooled anode with carbon anode holder
The anode holder shown in figure 2 was designed with two goals in mind .
The heat losses of the holder were to be reduced as far as possible and they should be such that an accurate heat balance can be made .
In order to reduce the number of variable parameters , all experiments were made with a constant arc length of 0.5'' '' and a current of 100 Aj .
The argon flow through the porous anode was varied systematically between Af and Af .
The lower limit was determined by the fact that for smaller flow rates the arc started to strike to the anode holder instead of to the porous graphite plug and that it became highly unstable .
The upper limit was determined by the difficulty of measuring the characteristic anode surface temperature ( see below ) since only a small region of the anode was struck by the arc .
This region which had a higher temperature than the rest of the anode surface changed size and location continuously .
For each mass flow rate the arc voltage was measured .
To measure the surface temperature of the anode plug , the surface was scanned with a pyrometer .
As it turned out , a very hot region occurred on the plug .
Its temperature was denoted by Af .
The size of this hot region was estimated by eye .
The rest of the surface had a temperature which decreased towards the outer diameter of the plug .
The mean temperature of this region was approximated by the temperature measured halfways between the edge of the hot spot and the rim of the plug .
It was denoted by Af .
The mean temperature of the surface was then computed according to the following relation : Af where x is the fraction of the plug area covered by the hot spot .
Assuming thermal equilibrium between the anode surface and the transpiring argon , the gas enthalpy rise through the anode was calculated according to the relation Af whereby the specific heat of argon was taken as Af .
This calculation results in an enthalpy rise which is somewhat high because it assumes a mass flow equally distributed over the plug cross section whereas in reality the mass velocity is expected to be smaller in the regions of higher temperatures .
The upstream gas temperature measured with the thermocouple shown in figure 2 was Af .
The Af values are listed in Table 1 together with the measured surface temperatures and arc voltages .
Simultaneously with the anode surface temperature and voltage measurements pyrometer readings were taken along the cylindrical surface of the carbon anode holder as indicated on figure 2 .
Some of these temperatures are plotted in figure 4 .
They showed no marked dependence on the flow rate within the accuracy of these measurements .
Thus , the dotted line shown in figure 4 was taken as typical for the temperature distribution for all blowing rates .
The thermocouples in the aluminum disk shown in figure 2 indicated an equilibrium temperature of the surface of Af .
This temperature was taken as environmental temperature to which the anode holder was exposed as far as radiation is concerned .
It is sufficiently small compared with the surface temperature of the anode holder , to make the energy flux radiated from the environment toward the anode holder negligible within the accuracy of the present measurements .
The reflection of radiation originating from the anode holder and reflected back to it by the surrounding metal surfaces should also be small because of the peculiar characteristic of the metal surfaces and of the specific geometry .
The total heat loss through the anode holder included also the heat conducted through the base of the cylindrical piece into the adjacent metal parts .
It was calculated from the temperature gradient Af at Af inch as Af .
The total heat flux from the porous plug into the plug holder is thereby Af .
The temperature distribution of figure 4 gives Af for all blowing rates , assuming Af .
The temperature dependent value of **ye was taken from Ref. 7 .
The radiation loss from the anode surface was computed according to Af where Af is the mean of the fourth powers of the temperatures Af and Af calculated analogously to equation ( 1 ) .
A band viscometer is shown in Figure 2 .
It consists of two blocks with flat surfaces held apart by shims .
There is a small well in the top in which the fluid or paste to be tested is placed .
A tape of cellulose acetate is pulled between the blocks and the tape pulls the fluid or paste with it between the parallel faces of the blocks .
In normal use weights are hung on the end of the tape and allowed to pull the tape and the material to be tested between the blocks .
After it has reached terminal velocity , the time for the tape to travel a known distance is recorded .
By the use of various weights , data for a force-rate of shear graph can be obtained .
The instrument used for this work was a slight modification of that previously described .
In this test a Af tape was pulled between the blocks with a motor and pulley at a rate of Af with a clearance of 0.002'' '' on each side of the tape .
This gives a rate of shear of Af .
This , however , can only be considered approximate , as the diameter of the pulley was increased by the build-up of tape and the tape was occasionally removed from the pulley during the runs .
The face of one block contained a hole 1/16'' '' in diameter which led to a manometer for the measurement of the normal pressure .
Although there were only four fluids tested , it was apparent that there were two distinct types .
Two of the fluids showed a high-positive normal pressure when undergoing shear , and two showed small negative pressures which were negligible in comparison with the amount of the positive pressures generated by the other two .
Figure 3 shows the data on a silicone fluid , labeled 12,500 cps which gave a high positive normal pressure .
Although the tape was run for over 1 hr. , a steady state was not reached , and it was concluded that the reason for this was that the back pressure of the manometer was built up from the material fed from between the blocks and this was available at a very slow rate .
A system had to be used which did not depend upon the feeding of the fluid into the manometer if measurements of the normal pressure were to be made in a reasonable time .
A back pressure was then introduced , and the rise or fall of the material in the manometer indicated which was greater , the normal pressure in the block or the back pressure .
By this method it was determined that the normal pressure exerted by a sample of polybutene ( molecular weight reported to be 770 ) was over half an atmosphere .
The actual pressure was not determined because the pressure was beyond the upper limit of the apparatus on hand .
The two fluids which gave the small negative pressures were polybutenes with molecular weights which were stated to be 520 and 300 .
These are fluids which one would expect to be less viscoelastic or more Newtonian because of their lower molecular weight .
The maximum suction was 3.25'' '' of test fluid measured from the top of the block , and steady states were apparently reached with these fluids .
It is presumed that this negative head was associated with some geometric factor of the assembly , since different readings were obtained with the same fluid and the only apparent difference was the assembly and disassembly of the apparatus .
This negative pressure is not explained by the velocity head Af since this is not sufficient to explain the readings by several magnitudes .
These experiments can be considered exploratory only .
However , they do demonstrate the presence of large normal pressures in the presence of flat shear fields which were forecast by the theory in the first part of the paper .
They also give information which will aid in the design of a more satisfactory instrument for the measurement of the normal pressures .
Such an instrument would be useful for the characterization of many commercial materials as well as theoretical studies .
The elasticity is a parameter of fluids which is not subject to simple measurement at present , and it is a parameter which is probably varying in an unknown manner with many commercial materials .
Such an instrument is expected to be especially useful if it could be used to measure the elasticity of heavy pastes such as printing inks , paints , adhesives , molten plastics , and bread dough , for the elasticity is related to those various properties termed `` length '' , `` shortness '' , `` spinnability '' , etc. , which are usually judged by subjective methods at present .
The actual change Af caused by a shear field is calculated by multiplying the pressure differential times the volume , just as it is for any gravitational or osmotic pressure head .
If the volume is the molal volume , then Af is obtained on a molal basis which is the customary terminology of the chemists .
Although the Af calculation is obvious by analogy with that for gravitational field and osmotic pressure , it is interesting to confirm it by a method which can be generalized to include related effects .
Consider a shear field with a height of H and a cross-sectional area of A opposed by a manometer with a height of H ( referred to the same base as H ) and a cross-sectional area of A .
If Af is the change per unit volume in Gibbs function caused by the shear field at constant P and T , and **yr is the density of the fluid , then the total potential energy of the system above the reference height is Af .
Af is the work necessary to fill the manometer column from the reference height to H .
The total volume of the system above the reference height is Af , and H can be eliminated to obtain an equation for the total potential energy of the system in terms of H .
The minimum total potential energy is found by taking the derivative with respect to H and equating to zero .
This gives Af , which is the pressure .
This is interesting for it combines both the thermodynamic concept of a minimum Gibbs function for equilibrium and minimum mechanical potential energy for equilibrium .
This method can be extended to include the concentration differences caused by shear fields .
The relation between osmotic pressure and the Gibbs function may also be developed in an analogous way .
In the above development we have applied the thermodynamics of equilibrium ( referred to by some as thermostatics ) to the steady state .
This can be justified thermodynamically in this case , and this will be done in a separate paper which is being prepared .
This has an interesting analogy with the assumption stated by Philippoff that `` the deformational mechanics of elastic solids can be applied to flowing solutions '' .
There is one exception to the above statement as has been pointed out , and that is that fluids can relax by flowing into fields of lower rates of shear , so the statement should be modified by stating that the mechanics are similar .
If the mechanics are similar , we can also infer that the thermodynamics will also be similar .
The concept of the strain energy as a Gibbs function difference Af and exerting a force normal to the shearing face is compatible with the information obtained from optical birefringence studies of fluids undergoing shear .
Essentially these birefringence studies show that at low rates of shear a tension is present at 45-degrees to the direction of shear , and as the rate of shear increases , the direction of the maximum tension moves asymptotically toward the direction of shear .
According to Philippoff , the recoverable shear S is given by Af where **yc is the angle of extinction .
From this and the force of deformation it should be possible to calculate the elastic energy of deformation which should be equal to the Af calculated from the pressure normal to the shearing face .
There is another means which should show the direction and relative value of the stresses in viscoelastic fluids that is not mentioned as such in the literature , and that is the shape of the suspended drops of low viscosity fluids in shear fields .
These droplets are distorted by the normal forces just as a balloon would be pulled or pressed out of shape in one's hands .
These droplets appear to be ellipsoids , and it is mathematically convenient to assume that they are .
If they are not ellipsoids , the conclusions will be a reasonable approximation .
The direction of the tension of minimum pressure is , of course , given by the direction of the major axis of the ellipsoids .
Mason and Taylor both show that the major axis of the ellipsoids is at 45-degrees at low rates of shear and that it approaches the direction of shear with increased rates of shear .
( Some suspensions break up before they are near to the direction of shear , and some become asymptotic to it without breakup .
) This is , of course , a similar type of behavior to that indicated by birefringence studies .
The relative forces can be calculated from the various radii of curvature if we assume : ( A ) The surface tension is uniform on the surface of the drop .
( B ) That because of the low viscosity of the fluid , the internal pressure is the same in all directions .
( C ) The kinetic effects are negligible .
( D ) Since the shape of the drop conforms to the force field , it does not appreciably affect the distribution of forces in the fluid .
These are reasonable assumptions with low viscosity fluids suspended in high viscosity fluids which are subjected to low rates of shear .
Just as the pressure exerted by surface tension in a spherical drop is Af and the pressure exerted by surface tension on a cylindrical shape is Af , the pressure exerted by any curved surface is Af , where **yg is the interfacial tension and Af and Af are the two radii of curvature .
This formula is given by Rumscheidt and Mason .
If A is the major axis of an ellipsoid and B and C are the other two axes , the radius of curvature in the ab plane at the end of the axis Af , and the difference in pressure along the A and B axes is Af .
There are no data published in the literature on the shape of low viscosity drops to confirm the above formulas .
However , there are photographs of suspended drops of cyclohexanol phthalate ( viscosity 155 poises ) suspended in corn syrup of 71 poises in a paper by Mason and Bartok .
This viscosity of the material in the drops is , of course , not negligible .
Measurements on the photograph in this paper give Af at the maximum rate of shear of Af .
If it is assumed that the formula given by Lodge of cosec Af applies , the pressure difference along the major axes can be calculated from the angle of inclination of the major axis , and from this the interfacial tension can be calculated .
Its value was Af from the above data .
This appears to be high , as would be expected from the appreciable viscosity of the material in the drops .
It is appropriate to call attention to certain thermodynamic properties of an ideal gas that are analogous to rubber-like deformation .
The internal energy of an ideal gas depends on temperature only and is independent of pressure or volume .
In other words , if an ideal gas is compressed and kept at constant temperature , the work done in compressing it is completely converted into heat and transferred to the surrounding heat sink .
This means that work equals Q which in turn equals Af .
There is a well-known relationship between probability and entropy which states that Af , where **zq is the probability that state ( i.e. , volume for an ideal gas ) could be reached by chance alone .
This is known as conformational entropy .
This conformational entropy is , in this case , equal to the usual entropy , for there are no other changes or other energies involved .
Note that though the ideal gas itself contains no additional energy , the compressed gas does exert an increased pressure .
The energy for any isothermal work done by the perfect gas must come as thermal energy from its surroundings .
A proton magnetic resonance study of polycrystalline Af as a function of magnetic field and temperature is presented .
Af is paramagnetic , and electron paramagnetic dipole as well as nuclear dipole effects lead to line broadening .
The lines are asymmetric and over the range of field Af gauss and temperature Af the asymmetry increases with increasing Af and decreasing T .
An isotropic resonance shift of Af to lower applied fields indicates a weak isotropic hyperfine contact interaction .
The general theory of resonance shifts is used to derive a general expression for the second moment Af of a polycrystalline paramagnetic sample and is specialized to Af .
The theory predicts a linear dependence of Af on Af , where J is the experimentally determined Curie-Weiss constant .
The experimental second moment Af conforms to the relation Af in agreement with theory .
Hence , the electron paramagnetic effects ( slope ) can be separated from the nuclear effects ( intercept ) .
The paramagnetic dipole effects provide some information on the particle shapes .
The nuclear dipole effects provide some information on the motions of the hydrogen nuclei , but the symmetry of the Af bond in Af remains in doubt .
Introduction
the magnetic moment of an unpaired electron associated nearby may have a tremendous influence on the magnetic resonance properties of nuclei .
It is important to consider and experimentally verify this influence since quantitative nuclear resonance is becoming increasingly used in investigations of structure .
Af appeared to be well suited for the study of these matters , since it is a normal paramagnet , with three unpaired electrons on the chromium , its crystal structure is very simple , and the unknown position of the hydrogen in the strong Af bond provides structural interest .
We first discuss the Af bond in Af .
We then outline the theory of the interaction of paramagnetic dipoles with nuclei and show that the theory is in excellent agreement with experiment .
Indeed it is possible to separate electron paramagnetic from nuclear effects .
The information provided by the electron paramagnetic effects is then discussed , and finally the nuclear effects are interpreted in terms of various motional-modified models of the Af bond in Af .
Af bond in Af
Theoretical studies of the hydrogen bond generally agree that the Af bond will be linear in the absence of peculiarities of packing in the solid .
Moreover , it will be asymmetric until a certain critical Af distance is reached , below which it will become symmetric .
There is ample evidence from many sources that the Af bond in Af is symmetric .
The Af distance in Af is 2.26 Aj .
There is evidence , though less convincing than for Af , that the Af bond in nickel dimethylglyoxime is symmetric .
Here the Af distance is 2.44 Aj .
A number of semiempirical estimates by various workers lead to the conclusion that the Af bond becomes symmetric when the Af bond length is about 2.4 to 2.5 A , but aside from the possible example of nickel dimethylglyoxime there have been no convincing reports of symmetric Af bonds .
Douglass has studied the crystal structure of Af by x-ray diffraction .
He finds the structure contains an Af bond with the Af distance of Af .
There is , then , the possibility that this Af bond is symmetric , although Douglass was unable to determine its symmetry from his x-ray data .
Douglass found Af to be trigonal , Laue symmetry Af , with Af , Af .
X-ray and experimental density showed one formula unit in the unit cell , corresponding to a paramagnetic ion density of Af .
The x-ray data did not permit Douglass to determine uniquely the space group , but a negative test for piezoelectricity led him to assume a center of symmetry .
Under this assumption the space group must be Af and the following are the positions of the atoms in the unit cell .
Af .
This space group requires the hydrogen bond to be symmetric .
Douglass found powder intensity calculations and measurements to agree best for Af .
These data lead to a structure in which sheets of Cr atoms lie between two sheets of O atoms .
The O atoms in each sheet are close packed and each Cr atom is surrounded by a distorted octahedron of O atoms .
The Af layers are stacked normal to the ( 111 ) axis with the lower oxygens of one layer directly above the upper oxygens of the neighboring lower layer , in such a manner that the repeat is every three layers .
The separate layers are joined together by hydrogen bonds .
A drawing of the structure is to be found in reference 6 .
The gross details of the structure appear reasonable .
The structure appears to be unique among OOH compounds , but is the same as that assumed by Af .
The bond angles and distances are all within the expected limits and the volume per oxygen is about normal .
However , the possible absence of a center of symmetry not only moves the hydrogen atom off Af , but also allows the oxygen atoms to become nonequivalent , with Af at Af and Af at Af ( space group Af ) , where Af represents the oxygens on one side of the Af layers and Af those on the other side .
However , any oxygen nonequivalence would shorten either the already extremely short Af interlayer distance of 2.55 A or the non-hydrogen-bonded Af interlayer interactions which are already quite short at 2.58 Aj .
Hence it is difficult to conceive of a packing of the atoms in this material in which the oxygen atoms are far from geometrical equivalence .
The only effect of lack of a center would then be to release the hydrogen atoms to occupy general , rather than special , positions along the ( 111 ) axis .
If the Af bond is linear then there are three reasonable positions for the hydrogen atoms : ( 1 ) The hydrogen atoms are centered and hence all lie on a sheet midway between the oxygen sheets ; ;
( 2 ) all hydrogen atoms lie on a sheet , but the sheet is closer to one oxygen sheet than to the other ; ;
( 3 ) hydrogen atoms are asymmetrically placed , either randomly or in an ordered way , so that some hydrogen atoms are closer to the upper oxygen atoms while others are closer to the lower oxygen atoms .
Position ( 2 ) appears to us to be unlikely in view of the absence of a piezoelectric effect and on general chemical structural grounds .
A randomization of `` ups '' and `` downs '' is more likely than ordered `` ups '' and `` downs '' in position ( 3 ) since the hydrogen atoms are well separated and so the position of one could hardly affect the position of another , and also since ordered `` up '' and `` down '' implies a larger unit cell , for which no evidence exists .
Therefore , the only unknown structural feature would appear to be whether the hydrogen atoms are located symmetrically ( 1 ) or asymmetrically ( 3 ) .
Experimental procedures
samples
Douglass prepared his sample of Af by thermal decomposition of aqueous chromic acid at 300 - 325-degrees-C .
Dr. Douglass was kind enough to lend us about 5 grams of his material .
This material proved to be unsatisfactory , since we could not obtain reproducible results on various portions of the sample .
Subsequently , we learned from Douglass that his sample contained a few percent Af impurity .
Since Af is ferromagnetic , we felt that any results obtained from the magnetically contaminated Af would be suspect .
Plane suggested another preparation of Af which we used here .
500 ml of 1M aqueous Af with 1 Af added are heated in a bomb at 170-degrees-C for 48 hours .
A very fine , gray solid ( about 15 g ) is formed , water-washed by centrifugation , and dried at 110-degrees-C ) .
Differential thermal analysis showed a very small endothermic reaction at 340-degrees-C and a large endothermic reaction at 470-degrees-C .
This latter reaction is in accord with the reported decomposition of Af .
Thermogravimetric analysis showed a weight loss of 1.8% centered at 337-degrees-C and another weight loss of 10.8% at 463-degrees-C .
The expected weight loss for Af going to Af and Af is 10.6% .
Mass spectrometric analysis of gases evolved upon heating to 410-degrees-C indicated nitrogen oxides and water vapor .
The small reaction occurring at 337-degrees-C is probably caused by decomposition of occluded nitrates , and perhaps by a small amount of some hydrous material other than Af .
All subsequent measurements were made on material which had been heated to 375-degrees-C for one hour .
Emission spectra indicated Af calcium and all other impurities much lower .
Chromium analysis gave 58.8% Cr as compared with 61.2% theory .
However , Af adsorbs water from the atmosphere and this may account for the low chromium analysis and high total weight loss .
The x-ray diffraction pattern of the material , taken with CuK**ya radiation , indicated the presence of no extra lines and was in good agreement with the pattern of Douglass .
Magnetic analyses by R. G. Meisenheimer of this laboratory indicated no ferromagnetic impurities .
Af was found to be paramagnetic with three unpaired electrons per chromium atom and a molecular susceptibility of Af , where Af .
For exactly three unpaired electrons the coefficient would be 3.10 .
An infrared spectrum , obtained by H. A. Benesi and R. G. Snyder of this laboratory , showed bands in the positions found by Jones .
Electron microscopic examination of the Af sample showed it to be composed of nearly isotropic particles about 0.3M in diameter .
The particles appeared rough and undoubtedly the single-crystal domains are smaller than this .
The x-ray data are consistent with particle sizes of 1000 A or greater .
We found no obvious effects due to preferred orientation of the crystallites in this sample nor would we expect to on the basis of the shape found from electron microscopic examination .
Nuclear magnetic resonance ( NMR ) measurements
The magnetic resonance absorption was detected by employing a Varian model Af broad line spectrometer and the associated 12-inch electromagnet system .
One measurement at 40 Mc/sec was obtained with the Varian model Af unit .
A bridged-T type of bridge was used in the 10 - 16 Mc/sec range .
The rf power level was maintained small enough at all times to prevent obvious line shape distortions by saturation effects .
A modulation frequency of 40 cps with an amplitude as small as possible , commensurate with reasonably good signal-to-noise quality , was used .
Background spectra were obtained in all cases .
The spectrometer was adjusted to minimize the amount of dispersion mode mixed in with the absorption signal .
A single value of the thermal relaxation time Af at room temperature was measured by the progressive saturation method .
The value of Af estimated at 470 gauss was Af microseconds .
A single measurement of the spin - spin relaxation time Af was obtained at 10 Mc/sec by pulse methods .
This measurement was obtained by W. Blumberg of the University of California , Berkeley , by observing the breadth of the free induction decay signal .
The value derived was 16 microseconds .
Field shifts were derived from the mean value of the resonance line , defined as the field about which the first moment is zero .
Second moments of the spectra were computed by numerical integration .
Corrections were applied for modulation broadening , apparatus background , and field shift .
Spectra were obtained over the temperature range of 77 - 294-degrees-K .
For the low-temperature measurements the sample was cooled by a cold nitrogen gas flow method similar to that of Andrew and Eades .
The temperature was maintained to within about Af for the period of time required to make the measurement ( usually about one hour ) .
One sample , which had been exposed to the atmosphere after evacuation at 375-degrees-C , showed the presence of adsorbed water ( about 0.3 wt ) ) as evidenced by a weak resonance line which was very narrow at room temperature and which disappeared , due to broadening , at low temperature .
The data reported here are either from spectra from which the adsorbed water resonance could easily be eliminated or from spectra of samples evacuated and sealed off at 375-degrees-C which contain no adsorbed water .
The measured powder density of the Af used here was about Af , approximately one-third that of the crystal density ( Af ) .
Such a density corresponds to a paramagnetic ion density of about Af .
Spectra were obtained from a powdered sample having the shape of a right circular cylinder with a height-to-diameter ratio of 4 : :
1 .
The top of the sample was nearly flat and the bottom hemispherical .
Spectra were also obtained from a sample in a spherical container which was made by blowing a bubble on the end of a capillary glass tube .
The bubble was filled to the top and special precautions were taken to prevent any sample from remaining in the capillary .
Spectra were also obtained from a third sample of Af which had been diluted to three times its original volume with powdered , anhydrous alundum ( Af ) .
This sample was contained in a cylindrical container similar to that described above .
Polyphosphates gave renewed life to soap products at a time when surfactants were a threat though expensive , and these same polyphosphates spelled the decline of soap usage when the synergism between polyphosphates and synthetic detergent actives was recognized and exploited .
The market today for detergent builders is quite diverse .
The best known field of application for builders is in heavy-duty , spray-dried detergent formulations for household use .
These widely advertised products , which are used primarily for washing clothes , are based on high-sudsing , synthetic organic actives ( sodium alkylbenzenesulfonates ) and contain up to 50% by weight of sodium tripolyphosphate or a mixture of sodium tripolyphosphate and tetrasodium pyrophosphate .
In the household market , there are also low-sudsing detergent formulations based on nonionic actives with about the same amount of phosphate builder ; ;
light-duty synthetic detergents with much less builder ; ;
and the dwindling built-soap powders as well as soap flakes and granules , none of which are now nationally advertised .
A well-publicized entrant which has achieved success only recently is the built liquid detergent , with which the major problem today is incorporation of builder and active into a small volume using a sufficiently high builder/active ratio .
Hard-surface cleaning in household application is represented by two classes of alkaline products : ( 1 ) the formulations made expressly for machine dishwashers , and ( 2 ) the general-purpose cleaners used for walls and woodwork .
The better quality products in both of these lines contain phosphate builders .
In addition , many of the hard-surface cleaners used for walls and woodwork had their genesis in trisodium orthophosphate , which is still the major ingredient of a number of such products .
Many scouring powders now also contain phosphates .
These hard-surface cleaners are discussed in Chapter 28 .
The cleaning process
Cleaning or detergent action is entirely a matter of surfaces .
Wet cleaning involves an aqueous medium , a solid substrate , soil to be removed , and the detergent or surface-active material .
An oversimplified differentiation between soft- and hard-surface cleaning lies in the magnitude and kind of surface involved .
One gram of cotton has been found to have a specific surface area of Af .
In contrast , a metal coupon Af in size would have a magnitude from 100,000 to a million less .
Even here there is room for some variation , for metal surfaces vary in smoothness , absorptive capacity , and chemical reactivity .
Spring used a Brush surface-analyzer in a metal-cleaning study and showed considerable differences in soil removal , depending upon surface roughness .
There are considerable differences between the requirements for textile and hard-surface cleaning .
Exclusive of esthetic values , such as high- or low-foam level , perfume content , etc. , the requirements for the organic active used in washing textiles are high .
No matter how they are formulated , a large number of organic actives are simply not suitable for this application , since they do not give adequate soil removal .
This is best demonstrated by practical washing tests in which cloth articles are repeatedly washed with the same detergent formulation .
A good formulation will keep the clothes clean and white after many washings ; ;
whereas , with a poor formulation , the clothes exhibit a build-up of `` tattle-tale grey '' and dirty spots -- sometimes with bad results even after the first wash .
Since practical washing procedures are both lengthy and expensive , a number of laboratory tests have been developed for the numerical evaluation of detergents .
Harris has indicated that two devices , the Launder-Ometer and Terg-O-Tometer are most widely used for rapid detergent testing , and he has listed the commercially available standard soiled fabrics .
Also given are several laboratory wash procedures in general use .
The soiled fabrics used for rapid testing of detergent formulations are made in such a way that only part of the soil is removed by even the best detergent formulation in a single wash .
In this way , numerical values for the relative efficacy of various detergent formulations can be obtained by measuring the reflectance ( whiteness ) of the cloth swatches before and after washing .
Soil redeposition is evaluated by washing clean swatches with the dirty ones .
As is the case with the surface-active agent , the requirements for builders to be used in detergent compositions for washing textiles are also high .
Large numbers of potential builders have been investigated , but none have been found to be as effective as the polyphosphates over the relatively wide range of conditions met in practice .
The problems of hard-surface cleaning are not nearly as complex .
In hard-surface cleaning , the inorganic salts are more important than the organic active .
Indeed , when the proper inorganic constituents are employed , practically any wetting or surface-active agent will do a reasonably good job when present in sufficient amount in a hard-surface cleaning formulation .
Hydroxides , orthophosphates , borates , carbonates , and silicates are important inorganic ingredients of hard-surface cleaners .
In addition , the polyphosphates are also used , probably acting more as peptizing agents than anything else .
The importance of the inorganic constituents in hard-surface cleaning has been emphasized in a number of papers .
Physical chemistry of washing
Although there is no question but that the process of washing fabrics involves a number of phenomena which are related together in an extremely complicated way and that these phenomena and their interrelations are not well understood at the present , this section attempts to present briefly an up-to-date picture of the physical chemistry of washing either fabrics or hard surfaces .
The purpose of washing is , obviously , to remove soils which are arbitrarily classed in the four major categories given below : 1 .
Dirt , which is here defined as particulate material which is usually inorganic and is very often extremely finely divided so as to exhibit colloidal properties .
2 .
Greasy soils , which are typified by hydrocarbons and fats ( esters of glycerol with long-chain organic acids ) .
3 .
Stains , which include the wide variety of nonparticulate materials which give color even when present in very low concentration on the soiled object .
4 .
Miscellaneous soils , which primarily include sticky substances and colorless liquids which evaporate to leave a residue .
The dirt on the soiled objects is mechanically held by surface irregularities to some extent .
However , a major factor in binding dirt is the attraction between surfaces that goes under the name of Van der Waal's forces .
This is a theoretically complicated dipole interaction which causes any extremely small uncharged particle to agglomerate with other small uncharged particles , or to stick to an uncharged surface .
Obviously , if colloidal particles bear charges of opposite sign or , if one kind is charged and the other kind is not , the attraction will be intensified and the tendency to agglomerate will be greatly reinforced .
Likewise , a charged particle will tend to stick to an uncharged surface and vice versa , and a charged particle will be very strongly attracted to a surface exhibiting an opposite charge .
In addition , dirt particles can be held onto a soiled surface by sticky substances or by the surface tension of liquids , including liquid greases .
Greases , stains , and miscellaneous soils are usually sorbed onto the soiled surface .
In most cases , these soils are taken up as liquids through capillary action .
In an essentially static system , an oil cannot be replaced by water on a surface unless the interfacial tensions of the water phase are reduced by a surface-active agent .
The washing process whereby soils are removed consists basically of applying mechanical action to loosen the dirt particles and dried matter in the presence of water which helps to float off the debris and acts , to some extent , as a dissolving and solvating agent .
Greasy soils are hardly removed by washing in plain water ; ;
and natural waters , in addition , often contain impurities such as calcium salts which can react with soils to make them more difficult to remove .
Therefore , detergents are used .
The detergent active is that substance which primarily acts to remove greasy soils .
The other constituents in a built detergent assist in this and in the removal of dirty stains and the hydrophilic sticky or dried soils .
As is well known , detergent actives belong to the chemical class consisting of moderately high molecular weight and highly polar molecules which exhibit the property of forming micelles in solution .
Physicochemical investigations of anionic surfactants , including the soaps , have shown that there is little polymerization or agglomeration of the chain anions below a certain region of concentration called the critical micelle concentration .
( 1 ) Below the critical micelle concentration , monomers and some dimers are present .
( 2 ) In the critical micelle region , there is a rapid agglomeration or polymerization to give the micelles , which have a degree of polymerization averaging around 60 - 80 .
( 3 ) For anionics , these micelles appear to be roughly spherical assemblages in which the hydrocarbon tails come together so that the polar groups ( the ionized ends ) face outward towards the aqueous continuous phase .
Obviously hydrophobic ( oleophilic ) substances such as greases , oils , or particles having a greasy or oily surface are more at home in the center of a micelle than in the aqueous phase .
Micelles can imbibe and hold a considerable amount of oleophilic substances so that the micelle volume may be increased as much as approximately two-fold .
Although the matter has not been unequivocally demonstrated , the available data show that micelles in themselves do not contribute significantly to the detergency process .
Related to micelle formation is the technologically important ability of detergent actives to congregate at oil - water interfaces in such a manner that the polar ( or ionized ) end of the molecule is directed towards the aqueous phase and the hydrocarbon chain towards the oily phase .
In the cleaning process , sorbed greasy soils become coated in this manner with an oriented film of surfactant .
Then during washing , the greasy soil rolls back at the edges so that emulsified droplets can disengage themselves from the sorbed oil mass , with the aid of mechanical action , and enter the aqueous phase .
Obviously , a substance which is permanently or temporarily sorbed on the surface in place of the soil will tend to accelerate this process and effectively push off the greasy soil .
Substances other than detergent actives also tend to be strongly sorbed from aqueous media onto surfaces of other contiguous condensed phases .
This is particularly true of highly charged ions , especially those ions which fall into the class of polyelectrolytes .
Whereas the usual organic surface-active agent is strongly sorbed at oil - water interfaces , the highly charged ions are most strongly sorbed at interfaces between water and insoluble materials exhibiting an ionic structure ( see Table 26-2 on p. 1678 ) .
Thus , for aqueous media , we can think of the idealized organic active as an oleophilic or hydrophobic surface-active agent , and of an idealized builder as a oleophobic or hydrophilic surface-active agent .
From the equilibrium sorption data which are available , it seems logical to expect that polyphosphate ions would be strongly sorbed on the surface of the dirt ( especially clay soils ) so as to give it a greatly increased negative charge .
The charged particles then repel each other and are also repelled from the charged surface , which almost invariably bears a negative charge under washing conditions .
The negatively charged dirt particles then leave the surface and go into the aqueous phase .
This hypothesis is evolved in analogy to the demonstrated action of organic actives in detergency .
It does not consider the kinetic effects of the phosphate builders on sorption-desorption phenomena which will be discussed later ( see pp. 1746 - 1748 ) .
The crude picture of the detergency process thus far developed can be represented as : Af .
The influence of mechanical action on the particles of free soil may be compared to that of kinetic energy on a molecular scale .
Freed soil must be dispersed and protected against flocculation .
Cleaned cloth must be protected against the redeposition of dispersed soil .
It is evident that the requirements imposed by these effects upon any one detergent constituent acting alone are severe .
Upon consideration of the variety of soils and fabrics normally encountered in the washing process , it is little wonder that the use of a number of detergent constituents having `` synergistic '' properties has gained widespread acceptance .
In the over-all process , it is difficult to assign a `` pure '' role to each constituent of a built-detergent formulation ; ;
and , indeed , there is no more reason to separate the interrelated roles of the active , builder , antiredeposition agent , etc. than there is to assign individual actions to each of the numerous isomers making up a given commercial organic active .
The thermal exchange of chlorine between Af and liquid Af is readily measurable at temperatures in the range of 180-degrees and above .
The photochemical exchange occurs with a quantum yield of the order of unity in the liquid phase at 65-degrees using light absorbed only by the Af .
In the gas phase , with Af of Af and Af of Af , quantum yields of the order of Af have been observed at 85-degrees .
Despite extensive attempts to obtain highly pure reagents , serious difficulty was experienced in obtaining reproducible rates of reaction .
It appears possible to set a lower limit of about Af for the activation energy of the abstraction of a chlorine atom from a carbon tetrachloride molecule by a chlorine atom to form Af radical .
The rate of the gas phase exchange reaction appears to be proportional to the first power of the absorbed light intensity indicating that the radical intermediates are removed at the walls or by reaction with an impurity rather than by bimolecular radical combination reactions .

Because of the simplicity of the molecules , isotopic exchange reactions between elemental halogens and the corresponding carbon tetrahalides would appear to offer particularly fruitful possibilities for obtaining unambiguous basic kinetic data .
It would appear that it should be possible to determine unique mechanisms for the thermal and photochemical reactions in both the liquid and gas phases and to determine values for activation energies of some of the intermediate reactions of atoms and free radicals , as well as information on the heat of dissociation of the carbon-halogen bond .
The reaction of chlorine with carbon tetrachloride seemed particularly suited for such studies .
It should be possible to prepare very pure chlorine by oxidation of inorganic chlorides on a vacuum system followed by multiple distillation of the liquid .
It should be possible to free carbon tetrachloride of any interfering substances by the usual purification methods followed by prechlorination prior to addition of radioactive chlorine .
Furthermore , the exchange would not be expected to be sensitive to trace amounts of impurities because it would not be apt to be a chain reaction since the activation energy for abstraction of chlorine by a chlorine atom would be expected to be too high ; ;
also it would be expected that Af would compete very effectively with any impurities as a scavenger for Af radicals .
Contrary to these expectations we have found it impossible to obtain the degree of reproducibility one would wish , even with extensive efforts to prepare especially pure reagents .
We are reporting these investigations here briefly because of their relevancy to problems of the study of apparently simple exchange reactions of chlorine and because the results furnish some information on the activation energy for abstraction of chlorine atoms from carbon tetrachloride .
Experimental
reagents .
-- Matheson highest purity tank chlorine was passed through a tube of resublimed Af into an evacuated Pyrex system where it was condensed with liquid air .
It was then distilled at least three times from a trap at -78-degrees to a liquid air trap with only a small middle fraction being retained in each distillation .
The purified product was stored at -78-degrees in a tube equipped with a break seal .
Of several methods employed for tagging chlorine with radiochlorine , the exchange of inactive chlorine with tagged aluminum chloride at room temperature was found to be the most satisfactory .
To prepare the latter , silver chloride was precipitated from a solution containing Af obtained from the Oak Ridge National Laboratory .
The silver chloride was fused under vacuum in the presence of aluminum chips with the resultant product of Af which was sublimed into a flask on the vacuum line .
Previously purified chlorine was subsequently admitted and the exchange was allowed to take place .
The radiochlorine was stored at -78-degrees in a tube equipped with a break seal .
Liter quantities of Mallinckrodt , low sulfur , reagent grade carbon tetrachloride were saturated with Af and Af and illuminated for about 50 hours with a 1000 watt tungsten lamp at a distance of a few inches .
The mixture was then extracted with alkali and with water following which the carbon tetrachloride was distilled on a Vigreux column , a 25% center cut being retained which was then degassed under vacuum in the presence of Af .
Purified inactive chlorine was then added from one of the tubes described above and the mixture frozen out and sealed off in a flask equipped with a break seal .
This chlorine-carbon tetrachloride solution was illuminated for a day following which the flask was resealed onto a vacuum system and the excess chlorine distilled off .
The required amount of carbon tetrachloride was distilled into a series of reaction cells on a manifold on a vacuum line .
The desired amounts of inactive chlorine and radioactive chlorine were likewise condensed in these cells on the vacuum line following which they were frozen down and the manifold as a whole was sealed off .
The contents of the manifold for liquid phase experiments were then mixed by shaking , redistributed to the reaction tubes , frozen down , and each tube was then sealed off .
The reactants for the gas phase experiments were first frozen out in a side-arm attached to the manifold and then allowed to distil slowly into the manifold of pre-cooled reaction cells before sealing off .
This method in general solved the problem of obtaining fairly equal concentrations of reactants in each of the six cells from a set .
Reaction conditions and analysis .
-- The samples for liquid phase thermal reaction studies were prepared in Pyrex capillary tubing 2.5 mm. i.d. and about 15 cm. long .
In a few experiments the tubes were made from standard 6 mm. i.d. Pyrex tubing of 1 mm. wall thickness .
Both types of tube withstood the pressure of approximately 20 atmospheres exerted by the carbon tetrachloride at 220-degrees .
The photochemical reaction cells consisted of 10 mm. i.d. Pyrex tubing , 5.5 cm. long , diffraction effects being minimized by the fact that the light passed through only liquid-glass interfaces and not gas-glass interfaces .
These cells were used rather than square Pyrex tubing because of the tendency of the latter to shatter when thawing frozen carbon tetrachloride .
The round cells were reproducibly positioned in the light beam which entered the thermostated mineral oil-bath through a window .
Two types of light source were used , a thousand watt projection lamp and an AH6 high pressure mercury arc .
The light was filtered by the soft glass window of the thermostat thus ensuring that only light absorbed by the chlorine and not by the carbon tetrachloride could enter the reaction cell .
Relative incident light intensities were measured with a thermopile potentiometer system .
Changes of intensity on the cell were achieved by use of a wire screen and by varying the distance of the light source from the cell .
Following reaction the cells were scratched with a file and opened under a 20% aqueous sodium iodide solution .
Carrier Af was added and the aqueous and organic phases were separated ( cells containing gaseous reactants were immersed in liquid air before opening under sodium iodide ) .
After titration of the liberated Af with Af , aliquots of the aqueous and of the organic phase were counted in a solution-type Geiger tube .
In the liquid phase runs the amount of carbon tetrachloride in each reaction tube was determined by weighing the tube before opening and weighing the fragments after emptying .
The fraction of exchange was determined as the ratio of the counts / minute observed in the carbon tetrachloride to the counts / minute calculated for the carbon tetrachloride fractions for equilibrium distribution of the activity between the chlorine and carbon tetrachloride , empirically determined correction being made for the difference in counting efficiency of Af in Af and Af .
Results
the thermal reaction .
-- In studying the liquid phase thermal reaction , some 70 tubes from 12 different manifold fillings were prepared and analyzed .
Experiments were done at 180 , 200 , 210 , and 220-degrees .
Following observation of the fact that the reaction rates of supposedly identical reaction mixtures prepared on the same filling manifold and exposed under identical conditions often differed by several hundred per cent , a systematic series of experiments was undertaken to see whether the difficulty could be ascribed to the method of preparing the chlorine , to the effects of oxygen or moisture or to the effect of surface to volume ratio in the reaction tubes .
In addition to the method described in the section above , chlorine and radiochlorine were prepared by the electrolysis of a Af eutectic on the vacuum line , and by exchange of Af with molten Af .
Calcium hydride was substituted for Af as a drying agent for carbon tetrachloride .
No correlation between these variables and the irreproducibility of the results was found .
The reaction rates observed at 200-degrees ranged from Af of the chlorine exchanged per hour to 0.7 exchanged per hour .
In most cases the chlorine concentration was about Af .
Sets of reaction tubes containing 0.2 of an atmosphere of added oxygen in one case and added moisture in another , both gave reaction rates in the range of 0.1 to 0.4 of the chlorine exchanged per hour .
No detectable reaction was found at room temperature for reaction mixtures allowed to stand up to 5 hours .
The liquid phase photochemical reaction .
The liquid phase photochemical exchange between chlorine and carbon tetrachloride was more reproducible than the thermal exchange , although still erratic .
The improvement was most noticeable in the greater consistency among reaction cells prepared as a group on the same manifold .
Rather large differences were still found between reaction cells from different manifold fillings .
Some 80 reaction tubes from 13 manifold fillings were illuminated in the temperature range from 40 to 85-degrees in a further endeavor to determine the cause of the irreproducibility and to obtain information on the activation energy and the effect of light intensity .
In all cases there was readily measurable exchange after as little as one hour of illumination .
By comparing reaction cells sealed from the same manifold temperature dependency corresponding to activation energies ranging from 11 to 18 Af was observed while dependence on the first power of the light intensity seemed to be indicated in most cases .
It was possible to make estimates of the quantum yield by observing the extent of reduction of a uranyl oxalate actinometer solution illuminated for a known time in a typical reaction cell and making appropriate conversions based on the differences in the absorption spectra of uranyl oxalate and of chlorine , and considering the spectral distribution of the light source .
These estimates indicated that the quantum yield for the exchange of chlorine with liquid carbon tetrachloride at 65-degrees is of the order of magnitude of unity .
When typical reaction cells to which 0.3 of an atmosphere of oxygen had been added were illuminated , chlorine and phosgene were produced .
Exchange was also observed in these cells , which had chlorine present at Af .
The photochemical exchange in the gas phase .
-- Although there was some variation in results which must be attributed either to trace impurities or to variation in wall effects , the photochemical exchange in the gas phase was sufficiently reproducible so that it seemed meaningful to compare the reaction rates in different series of reaction tubes for the purpose of obtaining information on the effect of chlorine concentration and of carbon tetrachloride concentration on the reaction rate .
Data on such comparisons together with data on the effect of light intensity are given in Table 1 .
,
In series 1 , the relative light intensity was varied by varying the distance of the lamp from the reaction cell over the range from 14.7 to 29.2 cm. .
The last column shows the rate of exchange that would have been observed at a relative intensity of 4 ( 14.7 cm. distance ) calculated on the assumptions that the incident light intensity is inversely proportional to the square of the distance of the lamp from the cell and that the rate is directly proportional to the incident light intensity .
Direct proportionality of the rate to the incident intensity has also been assumed in obtaining the value in the last column for the fourth sample of series 2 , where the light intensity was reduced by use of a screen .
The Poynting-Robertson effect ( Robertson , 1937 ; ;
Wyatt and Whipple , 1950 ) , which is a retardation of the orbital motion of particles by the relativistic aberration of the repulsive force of the impinging solar radiation , causes the dust to spiral into the sun in times much shorter than the age of the Earth .
The radial velocity varies inversely as the particle size -- a 1000-m-diameter particle near the orbit of Mars would reach the sun in about 60 million years .
Whipple ( 1955 ) extends the effects to include the solar-corpuscular-radiation pressure , which increases both the minimum particle size and the drag .
Further , the corpuscular radiation , i.e. , the solar-wind protons , must sputter away the surface atoms of the dust and cause a slow diminution in size , with a resultant increase in both the Poynting-Robertson effect and the ratio of the repulsive force to the gravitational force .
The Poynting-Robertson effect causes the semi-major axis of orbits to diminish more rapidly than the semi-minor axis , with a consequent tendency toward circular orbits as the particles move toward the sun .
Also , planetary gravitational attraction increases the dust concentration near the plane of the ecliptic as the sun is approached .
At one astronomical unit from the sun ( the Earth's distance ) the dust orbits are probably nearly circular .
If such is the case , the particles within a distance of about Af of the Earth will have , relative to the Earth , a kinetic energy less than their potential energy and they will be captured into orbits about the Earth .
De Jager ( 1955 ) has calculated the times required for these particles to reach the atmosphere under the influence of the Poynting-Robertson effect , which in this case causes the orbits to become more and more eccentric without changing the semi-major axis .
This effect can give rise to a blanket of micrometeorites around the Earth .
Since there is a continual loss of micrometeoritic material in space because of the radiation effects , there must be a continual replenishment : otherwise , micrometeorites would have disappeared from interplanetary space .
There are several possible sources .
According to Whipple ( 1955 ) , cometary debris is sufficient to replenish the material spiraling into the sun , maintaining a fairly steady state .
Asteroidal collisions are also thought to contribute material .
It is also possible that some of the dust in the vicinity of the Earth originated from meteoritic impacts upon the moon .
5.3 direct measurements of micrometeorite flux
One cannot make a very satisfactory guess about the micrometeorite flux in space .
Even in the neighborhood of the Earth , where information has been obtained both directly and indirectly , the derived flux values vary by at least four orders of magnitude .
This large discrepancy demonstrates the inadequacies of the experimental methods and the lack of understanding of the various phenomena involved .
Beyond a few million kilometers from the Earth , but still in the region of the Earth's orbit , a prediction of the flux of dust is even more unreliable .
At greater distances from the sun , the situation is still less certain .
There are several sources of evidence on the micrometeorite environment .
Direct information has been obtained from rockets and satellites equipped with impact sensors .
In addition , the size distribution obtained from visual and radar observations of meteors may be extrapolated to the micrometeorite domain .
From the brightness of the F component of the solar corona and the brightness of the zodiacal light , an estimate of the particle sizes , concentrations , and spatial distribution can be derived for regions of space near the ecliptic plane .
Another important source of evidence only recently receiving much attention is the analysis of atmospheric dust for a meteoritic component .
The cores of deep-sea sediments and content of collectors in remote regions are valuable in this category .
The data provide a measure of the total mass of cosmic material incident upon the Earth .
The direct evidence on the micrometeorite environment near the Earth is obtained from piezoelectric sensors ( essentially microphones ) and from wire gages ; ;
these instruments are installed on rockets , satellites , and space probes .
Statistically , the most significant data have been collected from the sensors on 1958 Alpha ( Explorer 1 ) , 1958 Delta 2 ( Sputnik 3 ) , and 1959 Eta ( Vanguard 3 ) .
These vehicles , with large sensitive areas , have collected data for long enough times to give reliable impact rates for the periods of exposure .
Many other vehicles with smaller sensitive-area exposure-time products contribute some information .
The impact rate on 1958 Alpha for 153 events was Af for particles of mass greater than Af ( Dubin , 1960 ) ; ;
this mass threshold was derived from the detector calibration and an assumed impact velocity of Af .
The data show daily and diurnal variations .
Ninety per cent of the 153 recorded impacts occurred between midnight and noon , and from day to day the variation of the rate was as much as an order of magnitude .
One may conclude that most of the detected micrometeoritic material is concentrated in orbital streams which intersect the Earth's orbit .
There have been contradictory reports from 1958 Delta 2 , and the data quoted here are believed to be the more reliable .
On May 15 , a very large increase occurred with Af of mass between Af and Af ; ;
for the next two days , the impact rate was Af ; ;
and for the next nine days , the impact rate was less than Af ( Nazarova , 1960 ) .
The data for the first day indicate a meteor stream with a very high concentration of particles and may have led to the high estimates of micrometeorite flux .
Preliminary data from 1959 Eta give an average impact rate of Af for masses larger than Af for about 1000 events in a 22-day period ( LaGow and Alexander , 1960 ) .
The day-to-day rate varied by less than a factor of 4.5 .
The data have not yet been analyzed for diurnal variations .
Note that the mass threshold is four times that of 1958 Alpha and that the flux is one fifth as large .
If one assumes that the average flux did not change between measurements , a mass-distribution curve is obtained which relates the flux of particles larger than a given radius to the inverse 7/2 power of the radius .
Space probes have yielded little information .
Pioneer 1 , recorded a decrease in flux with distance from the Earth on the basis of 11 counts in 9 hours .
With detectors sensitive to three mass intervals and based on a few counts , the second and third Russian space probes indicate that the flux of the smallest particles detected is less than that of larger ones .
Being based on so few events , these results are of dubious validity .
The calibration of piezoelectric sensors in terms of the particle parameters is very uncertain .
Many workers believe that the response is proportional to the incident momentum of the particles , a relation deduced from laboratory results linearly extrapolated to meteoritic velocities .
However , one must expect that vaporization and ejection of material by hypervelocity impacts would cause a deviation from a linear relationship .
In the United States , most of the sensors are calibrated by dropping small spheres on their sensitive surfaces .
The Russian experimenters claim that only a small fraction of the impulse from the sensors is caused by the incident momentum with the remainder being momentum of ejected material from the sensor .
This `` ejection '' momentum is linearly related to the particle energy .
They quote about the same mass threshold as that of the U.S. apparatus , but a momentum threshold about 40 times greater .
There is a difference in the experimental arrangement , in that the U.S. microphones are attached directly to the vehicle skin while the Russian instruments are isolated from the skin .
The threshold mass is derived from the momentum threshold with the assumption of a mean impact velocity of Af in the U.S. work and Af in the U.S.S.R. work .
The threshold mass of about Af corresponds to a 10-M-diameter sphere of density Af .
However , the conversion from mass to size is unreliable , since many photographic meteors give evidence of a fluffy , loosely bound meteorite structure with densities as low as Af .
To what extent such low density applies to micrometeorites is unknown .
The velocity value used is also open to some question ; ;
if a substantial fraction of the dust is orbiting about the Earth , only about one third the above-mentioned average velocity should be used in deriving the mass .
Zodiacal light and the gegenschein give some evidence for such a dust blanket , a phenomenon also to be expected if the dust before capture is in circular orbits about the sun , as indicated by the trend of the smaller visible meteors .
The diurnal variation in the observed flux may be partly due to the dependence of the detector sensitivity on the incident velocity .
The flux of micrometeorites in the neighborhood of the Earth can be estimated by extrapolation from radar and visual meteor data .
A summary of meteorite data , prepared by Whipple ( 1958 ) on the basis of photographic , visual , and radar evidence , is given in Table 5-1 .
From an estimated mass of 25 g for a zero-magnitude meteorite , the other masses are derived with the assumption of a mass decrease by a factor of 2.512 for each unit increase in magnitude .
The radius is calculated from the mass by assuming spheres of density Af except for the smallest particles , which must have a higher mass density to remain in the solar system in the presence of solar-radiation pressure .
The flux values are for all particles with masses greater than the given mass and are based on an estimate of the numbers of visual meteors .
It is assumed that the flux values increase by a factor of 2.512 per magnitude , in accordance with the opinion that the total mass flux in each unit range in magnitude is constant .
The values agree with the data from 1958 Alpha and 1959 Eta .
The figures in the next-to-last column are derived with the assumption of 50 per cent shielding by the Earth ; ;
hence , these figures apply immediately above the Earth's atmosphere .
The unshielded flux is given in the last column ; ;
these figures constitute the best estimate for the flux in interplanetary space near the Earth .
Of course , if there is a dust blanket around the Earth , the fluxes in interplanetary space should be less than the figures given here .
Note that the mass scale is one to two orders of magnitude greater than some previously used ; ;
for example , Jacchia ( 1948 ) derived a scale of 0.15 g for a Af , zero-magnitude meteorite .
The older scales were based on theoretical estimates of the conversion efficiency of kinetic energy into light .
The mass scale used in Table 5-1 was derived on the assumption that the motion of the glowing trail is related to the momentum transfer to the trail by the meteorite , permitting the calculation of the mass if the velocity is known ( Cook and Whipple , 1958 ) .
A concentration distribution has been derived from radar observations sensitive to the fifteenth magnitude ( Manning and Eshleman , 1959 ) .
Extrapolation of this relationship through the thirtieth magnitude covers the range of micrometeorites .
The approximate equation is Af , where N is the number of Af with electron line-density greater than or equal to Af , and Q is proportional to the mass of the meteorite .
Therefore , N is inversely proportional to the radius cubed and in fair agreement with the inverse 7/2 power derived from 1958 Alpha and 1959 Eta data .
At the fifteenth magnitude , Af , and at the twenty-fifth magnitude , Af .
These extrapolated fluxes are about an order of magnitude less than the values from the satellite data and the figures in Whipple's table .
The extrapolation may be in error for several reasons .
The observational data determining the concentration distribution have a range of error which is magnified in the extension into the micrometeorite region .
The solar-electromagnetic- and corpuscular-radiation pressure and the associated Poynting-Robertson effect increase in effectiveness as the particle size decreases and modify the distribution and limit sizes to larger than a few microns .
Also , it has been suggested that the source of all or part of the dust may not be the same as that for visual or radar meteorites ( Best , 1960 ) , and the same distribution would not be expected .
5.4 .
Indirect indications of micrometeorite flux
A measure of the total mass accretion of meteoritic material by the Earth is obtained from analyses of deep-sea sediments and dust collected in remote regions ( Pettersson , 1960 ) .
Most meteoritic material , by the time it reaches the Earth's surface , has been reduced to dust or to spherules of ablated material in its passage through the atmosphere .
For all meteorites , the average nickel content is about 2.5 per cent .
This is much higher than the nickel content of terrestrial dusts and sediments and provides a basis for the determination of the meteoritic mass influx .
Present data indicate an accretion of about Af tons per year over the entire globe , or about Af .
Biological warfare
Biological warfare is the intentional use of living microorganisms or their toxic products for the purpose of destroying or reducing the military effectiveness of man .
It is the exploitation of the inherent potential of infectious disease agents by scientific research and development , resulting in the production of BW weapons systems .
Man may also be injured secondarily by damage to his food crops or domestic animals .
Biological warfare is considered to be primarily a strategic weapon .
The major reason for this is that it has no quick-kill effect .
The incubation period of infectious disease , plus a variable period of illness even before a lethal effect , render this weapon unsuitable for hand-to-hand encounter .
A man can be an effective fighting machine throughout the incubation period of most infectious diseases .
Thus , an enemy would probably use this weapon for attack on static population centers such as large cities .
An important operational procedure in BW for an enemy would be to create an areosol or cloud of agent over the target area .
This concept has stimulated much basic research concerning the behavior of particulate biological materials , the pathogenesis of respiratory infections , the medical management of such diseases and defense against their occurrence .
The biological and physical properties of infectious particles have been studied intensively during the past fifteen years .
Much new equipment and many unique techniques have been developed for the quantitative exposure of experimental animals to aerosols of infectious agents contained in particles of specified dimensional characteristics .
Much information has been gathered relative to quantitative sampling and assesment techniques .
Much of the older experimental work on respiratory infections was accomplished by very artificial procedures .
The intranasal instillation of a fluid suspension of infectious agent in an anesthetized animal is far different from exposure , through natural respiration , to aerosolized organisms .
The importance of particle size in such aerosols has been thoroughly demonstrated .
The natural anatomical and physiological defensive features of the upper respiratory tract , such as the turbinates of the nose and the cilia of the trachea and larger bronchi , are capable of impinging out the larger particles to which we are ordinarily exposed in our daily existence .
Very small particles , however , in a size range of 1 to 4 microns in diameter are capable of passing these impinging barriers and entering the alveolar bed of the lungs .
This area is highly susceptible to infection .
The entrance and retention of infectious particles in the alveoli amounts almost to an intratissue inoculation .
The relationship between particle size and infectious dose is illustrated in Table 1 .
In considering BW defense , it must be recognized that a number of critical meterological parameters must be met for an aerosol to exhibit optimum effect .
For example , bright sunlight is rapidly destructive for living microorganisms suspended in air .
There are optimal humidity requirements for various agents when airborne .
Neutral or inversion meteorological conditions are necessary for a cloud to travel along the surface .
It will rise during lapse conditions .
There are , of course , certain times during the 24-hour daily cycle when most of these conditions will be met .
Certain other properties of small particles , in addition to those already mentioned in connection with penetration of the respiratory tract , are noteworthy in defense considerations .
The smaller the particle the further it will travel downwind before settling out .
An aerosol of such small particles , moreover , diffuses through structures in much the same manner as a gas .
There may be a number of secondary effects resulting from diffusion through buildings such as widespread contamination of kitchens , restaurants , food stores , hospitals , etc. .
Depending on the organism , there may be multiplication in some food or beverage products , i.e. , in milk for example .
The secondary consequences from this could be very serious and must be taken into consideration in planning for defense .
Something of the behavior of clouds of small particles can be illustrated by the following field trials :
In the first trial an inert substance was disseminated from a boat travelling some ten miles off shore under appropriately selected meteorological conditions .
Zinc cadmium sulfide in particles of 2 microns in size were disseminated .
This material fluoresces under ultraviolet light which facilitates its sampling and assessment .
Four hundred and fifty pounds was disseminated while the ship was traveling a distance of 156 miles .
Figure 1 describes the results obtained in this trial .
The particles traveled a maximum detected distance of some 450 miles .
From these dosage isopleths it can be seen that an area of over 34,000 square miles was covered .
These dosages could have been increased by increasing the source strength which was small in this case .
The behavior of a biological aerosol , on a much smaller scale , is illustrated by a specific field trial conducted with a non-pathogenic organism .
An aqueous suspension of the spores of B. subtilis , var. niger , generally known as Bacillus globigii , was aerosolized using commercially available nozzles .
A satisfactory cloud was produced even though these nozzles were only about 5 per cent efficient in producing an initial cloud in the size range of 1 to 5 microns .
In this test , 130 gallons of a suspension , having a count of Af organisms per ml , or a total of approximately Af spores , was aerosolized .
The spraying operation was conducted from the rear deck of a small Naval vessel , cruising two miles off-shore and vertical to an on-sure breeze .
Spraying continued along a two-mile course .
This operation was started at 5:00 p.m. and lasted for 29 minutes .
There was a slight lapse condition , a moderate fog , and 100 per cent relative humidity .
A network of sampling stations had been set up on shore .
These were located at the homes of Government employees , in Government Offices , buildings and reservations within the trial area .
A rough attempt was made to characterize the vertical profile of the cloud by taking samples from outside the windows on the first , ninth , and fifteenth floors of a Government office building .
All samplers were operated for a period of two hours except one , which was operated for four hours .
In this instance , there was a dosage of 562 during the first two hours and a total dosage of 1980 for the four-hour period , a four-fold increase .
This suggests that the sampling period , particularly at the more distant locations , should have been increased .
As can be seen from Figure 2 , an extensive area was covered by this aerosol .
The maximum distance sampled was 23 miles from the source .
As can be seen from these dosage isopleths , approximately 100 square miles was covered within the area sampled .
It is quite likely that an even greater area was covered , particularly downwind .
The dosages in the three levels of the vertical profile were : Af
.
This was not , of course , enough sampling to give a satisfactory description of the vertical diffusion of the aerosol .
A number of unique medical problems might be created when man is exposed to an infectious agent through the respiratory route rather than by natural portal of entry .
Some agents have been shown to be much more toxic or infectious to experimental animals when exposed to aerosols of optimum particle size than by the natural portal .
Botulinal toxin , for example , is several thousand-fold more toxic by this route than when given per os .
In some instances a different clinical disease picture may result from this route of exposure , making diagnosis difficult .
In tularemia produced by aerosol exposure , one would not expect to find the classical ulcer of `` rabbit fever '' on a finger .
An enemy would obviously choose an agent that is believed to be highly infectious .
Agents that are known to cause frequent infections among laboratory workers such as those causing Q fever , tularemia , brucellosis , glanders , coccidioidomycosis , etc. , belong in this category .
An agent would likely be selected which would possess sufficient viability and virulence stability to meet realistic minimal logistic requirements .
It is , obviously , a proper goal of research to improve on this property .
In this connection it should be capable of being disseminated without excessive destruction .
Moreover , it should not be so fastidious in its growth requirements as to make production on a militarily significant scale improbable .
An aggressor would use an agent against which there was a minimal naturally acquired or artificially induced immunity in a target population .
A solid immunity is the one effective circumstance whereby attack by a specific agent can be neutralized .
It must be remembered , however , that there are many agents for which there is no solid immunity and a partial or low-grade immunity may be broken by an appropriate dose of agent .
There is a broad spectrum of organisms from which selection for a specified military purpose might be made .
An enemy might choose an acutely debilitating microorganism , a chronic disease producer or one causing a high rate of lethality .
It is possible that certain mutational forms may be produced such as antibiotic resistant strains .
Mutants may also be developed with changes in biochemical properties that are of importance in identification .
All of these considerations are of critical importance in considering defense and medical management .
Biological agents are , of course , highly host-specific .
They do not destroy physical structures as is true of high explosives .
This may be of overriding importance in considering military objectives .
The question of epidemic disease merits some discussion .
Only a limited effort has been devoted to this problem .
Some of those who question the value of BW have assumed that the only potential would be in the establishment of epidemics .
They then point out that with our present lack of knowledge of all the factors concerned in the rise and fall of epidemics , it is unlikely that a planned episode could be initiated .
They argue further ( and somewhat contradictorily ) that our knowledge and resources in preventive medicine would make it possible to control such an outbreak of disease .
This is why this approach to BW defense has not been given major attention .
Our major problem is what an enemy might accomplish in an initial attack on a target .
This , of course , does not eliminate from consideration for this purpose agents that are associated naturally with epidemic disease .
A hypothetical example will illustrate this point .
Let us assume that it would be possible for an enemy to create an aerosol of the causative agent of epidemic typhus ( Rickettsia prowazwki ) over City A and that a large number of cases of typhus fever resulted therefrom .
No epidemic was initiated nor was one expected because the population in City A was not lousy .
Lousiness is a prerequisite for epidemic typhus .
In this case , then , the military objective was accomplished with an epidemic agent solely through the results secured in the initial attack .
This was done with full knowledge that there would be no epidemic .
On the other hand , a similar attack might have been made on City B whose population was known to be lousy .
One might expect some spread of the disease in this case resulting in increased effectiveness of the attack .
The major defensive problems are concerned with the possibility of overt military delivery of biological agents from appropriate disseminating devices .
It should be no more difficult to deliver such devices than other weapons .
The same delivery vehicles -- whether they be airplanes , submarines or guided missiles -- should be usable .
If it is possible for an enemy to put an atomic bomb on a city , it should be equally possible to put a cloud of biological agent over that city .
Biological agents are , moreover , suitable for delivery through enemy sabotage which imposes many problems in defense .
A few obvious target areas of great importance might be mentioned .
The air conditioning and ventilating systems of large buildings are subject to attack .
America is rapidly becoming a nation that uses processed , precooked and even predigested foods .
This is an enormous industry that is subject to sabotage .
One must include the preparation of soft drinks and the processing of milk and milk products .
Huge industries are involved also in the production of biological products , drugs and cosmetics which are liable to this type of attack .
A variety of techniques have been directed toward the isolation and study of blood group antibodies .
These include low-temperature ethanol ( Cohn ) fractionation , electrophoresis , ultracentrifugation and column chromatography on ion exchange celluloses .
Modifications of the last technique have been applied by several groups of investigators .
Abelson and Rawson , using a stepwise elution scheme , fractionated whole sera containing ABO and Rh antibodies on diethylaminoethyl DEAE cellulose and carboxymethyl cellulose .
Speer and coworkers , in a similar study of blood group antibodies of whole sera , used a series of gradients for elution from Aj .
Fahey and Morrison used a single , continuous gradient at constant pH for the fractionation of anti-A and anti-B agglutinins from preisolated **yg-globulin samples .
In the present work whole sera have been fractionated by chromatography on DEAE-cellulose using single gradients similar to those described by Sober and Peterson , and certain chemical and serological properties of the fractions containing antibodies of the ABO and Rh systems have been described .
Materials and methods
samples .
Serum samples were obtained from normal group A , group B and group O donors .
Three of the anti-Rh sera used were taken from recently sensitized individuals .
One contained complete antibody and had a titer of 1 : 512 in saline .
The second contained incomplete antibody and showed titers of 1 : 256 in albumin and 1 : 2048 by the indirect Coombs test .
The third , containing the mixed type of complete and incomplete antibodies , had titers of 1 : 256 in saline , 1 : 512 in albumin and 1 : 1024 by the indirect Coombs test .
In addition one serum was obtained from a donor ( R. E. ) who had been sensitized 6 years previously .
This serum exhibited titers of 1 : 16 in albumin and 1 : 256 by the indirect Coombs test .
These antibody titers were determined by reaction with homozygous Af red cells .
Serological technique .
Anti-A and anti-B activities were determined in fractions from the sera of group A , group B or group O donors by the following tube agglutination methods .
One drop of each sample was added to one drop of a 2% suspension of group Af or group B red cells in a small Af test tube .
In several instances group O cells were also used as controls .
The red cells were used within 2 days after donation and were washed with large amounts of saline before use .
The mixtures of sample plus cell suspension were allowed to stand at room temperature for 1 Aj .
The tubes were then centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 1 min and examined macroscopically for agglutination .
For the albumin method , equal volumes of 30% bovine albumin , sample and 2% cells suspended in saline were allowed to stand at room temperature for 1 hr and then were centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 1 Aj .
All samples were tested by both the saline and albumin methods .
The activities of fractions of sera containing Rh antibodies were tested by the saline , albumin and indirect Coombs techniques .
Homozygous and heterozygous Af cells , Af and homozygous and heterozygous Af cells were used to test each sample ; ;
however , in the interest of clarity and conciseness only the results obtained with homozygous Af and homozygous Af cells will be presented here .
The saline and albumin tests were performed as described for the ABO samples except that the mixture was incubated for 1 hr at 37-degrees-C before centrifugation .
The saline tubes were saved and used for the indirect Coombs test in the following manner .
The cells were washed three times with saline , anti-human serum was added , the cells were resuspended , and the mixture was centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 1 min and examined for agglutination .
The anti-human sera used were prepared by injecting whole human serum into rabbits .
Those antisera shown by immunoelectrophoresis to be of the `` broad spectrum '' type were selected for use in the present study .
The red cells for the Rh antibody tests were used within 3 days after drawing except for the Af cells , which had been glycerolized and stored at -20-degrees-C for approximately 1 year .
These cells were thawed at 37-degrees-C for 30 min and were deglycerolized by alternately centrifuging and mixing with descending concentrations of glycerol solutions ( 20 , 18 , 10 , 8 , 4 and 2% ) .
The cells were then washed three times with saline and resuspended to 2% in saline .
Chromatography .
Blood samples were allowed to clot at room temperature for 3 hr , centrifuged and the serum was removed .
The serum was measured volumetrically and subsequently dialyzed in the cold for at least 24 hr against three to four changes , approximately 750 ml each , of `` starting buffer '' .
This buffer , pH 8.6 , was 0.005 M in Af and 0.039 M in tris(hydroxymethyl)-aminometha ( Tris ) .
After dialysis the sample was centrifuged and the supernatant placed on a Af cm column of EEAE-cellulose equilibrated with starting buffer .
The DEAE-cellulose , containing 0.78 mEq of N/g , was prepared in our laboratory by the method of Peterson and Sober ( 7 ) from powdered cellulose , 100 - 230 mesh .
The small amount of insoluble material which precipitated during dialysis was suspended in approximately 5 ml of starting buffer , centrifuged , resuspended in 2.5 ml of isotonic saline and tested for antibody activity .
The chromatography was done at 6-degrees-C using gradient elution , essentially according to Sober and Peterson .
The deep concave gradient employed ( fig. 2 ) was obtained with a nine-chambered gradient elution device ( `` Varigrad '' , reference ( 8 ) ) and has been described elsewhere .
The other , a shallow concave gradient ( Fig. 1 ) , was produced with a so-called `` cone-sphere '' apparatus , the `` cone '' being a 2-liter Erlenmeyer flask and the `` sphere , '' a 2-liter round-bottom flask .
Each initially contained 1700 ml of buffer ; ;
in the sphere was starting buffer and in the cone was final buffer , 0.50 M in both Af and Tris , pH 4.1 .
A flow rate of 72 Af was used and 12 ml fractions were collected .
Approximately 165 fractions were obtained from each column .
These were read at 280 m**ym in a Beckman model DU spectrophotometer and tested for antibody activity as described above .
Paper electrophoresis .
For protein identification , fractions from the column were concentrated by pervaporation against a stream of air at 5-degrees-C or by negative pressure dialysis in an apparatus which permitted simultaneous concentration of the protein and dialysis against isotonic saline .
During the latter procedure the temperature was maintained at 2-degrees-C by surrounding the apparatus with ice .
Because negative pressure dialysis gave better recovery of proteins , permitted detection of proteins concentrated from very dilute solutions and was a gentler procedure , it was used in all but the earliest experiments .
Paper electrophoresis was carried out on the concentrated samples in a Spinco model R cell using barbital buffer , pH 8.6 , ionic strength 0.075 , at room temperature on Whatman 3MM filter paper .
Five milliamperes/cell were applied for 18 hr , after which the strips were stained with bromphenol blue and densitometry was carried out using a Spinco Analytrol .
When paper electrophoresis was to be used for preparation , eight strips of a whole serum sample or a chromatographic fraction concentrated by negative pressure dialysis were run/chamber under the conditions described above .
At the end of the run , the strips in the third and sixth positions in each chamber were dried , stained for 1 hr , washed and dried , while the other strips were maintained in a horizontal position at 1-degree-C .
The unstained strips were then marked , using the stained ones as a guide , and cut transversely so as to separate the various protein bands .
The strip sections containing a given protein were pooled , eluted with 0.5 ml of isotonic saline , and the eluates were tested for antibody activity .
Ultracentrifugation .
Fractions from the column which were to be subjected to analytical ultracentrifugation were concentrated by negative pressure dialysis and dialyzed for 16 hr in the cold against at least 500 volumes of phosphate-buffered saline , pH 7.2 , ionic strength 0.154 .
They were then centrifuged at 59,780 Pm for 35 to 80 min at 20-degrees-C in a Spinco model E ultracentrifuge at a protein concentration of 1.00 to 1.25% .
Sedimentation coefficients were computed as Af values and relative amounts of the various components were calculated from the Schlieren patterns .
For preparative ultracentrifugation , fractions from the column were concentrated by negative pressure dialysis to volumes of 1 ml or less , transferred to cellulose tubes and diluted to 12 ml with isotonic saline .
Ultracentrifugation was then carried out in a Spinco model L ultracentrifuge at 40,000 rpm for 125 to 150 min , refrigeration being used throughout the run .
Successive 1-ml fractions were then drawn off with a hypodermic syringe , starting at the top of the tube , and tested for agglutinin activity .
Other methods will be described below .
Experimental and results
The insoluble material which precipitated during dialysis against starting buffer always showed intense agglutinin activity , regardless of the blood group of the donor .
With either of the gradients described , chromatography on DEAE-cellulose separated agglutinins of the ABO series into at least three regions ( Figs. 1 and 2 ) : one of extremely low anionic binding capacity , one of low anionic binding capacity and one of high anionic binding capacity .
These have been labeled Regions 1 , 2 , and 4 , respectively , in Fig. 1 .
When the early part of the gradient was flattened , either by using the gradient shown in Fig. 2 or by allowing the `` cone-sphere '' gradient to become established more slowly , Region 2 activity could sometimes be separated into two areas ( donors P. J. and R. S. , Fig. 1 and E. M. , Fig. 2 ) .
The latter procedure gave rise to a small active protein peak ( Region 1a ) between Regions 1 and 2 .
In 2 of 15 experiments on whole serum a region of agglutinin activity with intermediate anionic binding capacity was detected ( Region 3 , Fig. 1 ) .
Moreover , after concentration using negative pressure dialysis , agglutinin activity could sometimes be detected in the region designated 2a ( donors P. J. , D. A. , and J. F. , Fig. 1 ) .
Not all these regions exhibited equal agglutinating activity , as evidenced by titer and the extent of the active areas .
In all cases , most of the activity lay in the region of high anionic binding capacity .
This was particularly noticeable in group A and group B sera , in which cases activity in Regions 1 and 2 was usually not detectable without prior concentration and occasionally could not be detected at all .
There appeared to be no difference in the distribution of anti-A and anti-B activity in group O serum , though in two group O donors ( J. F. and E. M. ) only one type of agglutinin was found in the regions of low anionic binding capacity ( Figs. 1 and 2 ) .
Several samples of citrated plasma were fractionated in our laboratory by Method 6 of Cohn et al .
These fractions were tested for ABO agglutinin activity , using fractions from group AB plasma as a control .
As expected , most of the activity was found in Fraction Af , with slight activity seen in Fraction 4-1 .
A sample of Fraction Af from group O plasma was dissolved in starting buffer , dialyzed against this buffer and subjected to chromatography using the gradient shown in Fig. 2 .
Once again , both anti-A and anti-B activities were found in the insoluble material precipitated during dialysis .
Similarly , both types of antibodies were found in three regions of the chromatographic eluate , having extremely low , low , and high anionic binding capacity , respectively ( Fig. 3 ) .
Chromatography of whole sera revealed that the areas of Rh antibody activity were generally continuous and wide .
The incomplete antibody activity appeared in the early part of the chromatogram ; ;
the complete , in the latter part .
The serum containing the mixed type of complete and incomplete antibodies showed activity in both regions ( Fig. 1 ) .
In all cases the activity against Af cells was spread over a wider area than that with Af cells , regardless of the type of test ( saline , albumin , indirect Coombs ) used for comparison .
The insoluble material resulting from dialysis against starting buffer always showed strong activity .
In fact agglutination of Af cells in saline could be produced by the insoluble material from sera containing `` only '' incomplete antibody activity .
This was later known to be the result of concentrating the minute amount of complete antibody found in these sera ; ;
when the insoluble fraction was suspended in a volume of saline equal to that of the original serum sample , no complete antibody activity could be detected .
Apart from the honeybee , practically all bees and bumblebees hibernate in a state of torpor .
Occasionally , you may come across one or two bumblebees in the cold season , when you are turning over sods in your garden , but you have to be a really keen observer to see them at all .
They keep their wings and feet pressed tightly against their bodies , and in spite of their often colorful attire you may very well mistake them for lumps of dirt .
I must add at once that these animals are what we call `` queens '' , young females that have mated in the previous summer or autumn .
It is on them alone that the future of their race depends , for all their relatives ( mothers , husbands , brothers , and unmated sisters ) have perished with the arrival of the cold weather .
Even some of the queens will die before the winter is over , falling prey to enemies or disease .
The survivors emerge on some nice , sunny day in March or April , when the temperature is close to 50-degrees and there is not too much wind .
Now the thing for us to do is to find ourselves a couple of those wonderful flowering currants such as the red Ribes sanguineum of our Pacific Northwest , or otherwise a good sloe tree , or perhaps some nice pussy willow in bloom , preferably one with male or staminate catkins .
The blooms of Ribes and of the willow and sloe are the places where large numbers of our early insects will assemble : honeybees , bumblebees , and other wild bees , and also various kinds of flies .
It is a happy , buzzing crowd .
Each male willow catkin is composed of a large number of small flowers .
It is not difficult to see that the stamens of the catkin are always arranged in pairs , and that each individual flower is nothing but one such pair standing on a green , black-tipped little scale .
By scrutinizing the flowers , one can also notice that the scale bears one or two tiny warts .
Those are the nectaries or honey glands ( Fig. 26 , page 74 ) .
The staminate willow catkins , then , provide their visitors with both nectar and pollen ; ;
a marvelous arrangement , for it provides exactly what the bee queens need to make their beebread , a combination of honey and pollen with which the young of all species are fed .
The only exception to this is certain bees that have become parasites .
I will deal with these later on .
Quite often , honeybees form a majority on the willow catkins .
As we have already seen in the first chapter , bumblebees are bigger , hairier , and much more colorful than honeybees , exhibiting various combinations of black , yellow , white and orange .
Let us not try to key them out at this stage of the game , and let us just call them Bombus .
There must be several dozen species in the United States alone .
If you really insist on knowing their names , an excellent book on the North American species is Bumblebees And Their Ways by O. E. Plath .
If we manage to keep track of a Bombus queen after she has left her feeding place , we may discover the snug little hideout which she has fixed up for herself when she woke up from her winter sleep .
As befits a queen , a bumblebee female is rather choosy and may spend considerable time searching for a suitable nesting place .
Most species seem to prefer a ready-made hollow such as a deserted mouse nest , a bird house , or the hole made by a woodpecker ; ;
some show a definite liking for making their nest in moss .
Once she has made up her mind , the queen starts out by constructing , in her chosen abode , a small `` floor '' of dried grass or some woolly material .
On this , she builds an `` egg compartment '' or `` egg cell '' which is filled with that famous pollen-and-nectar mixture called beebread .
She also builds one or two waxen cups which she fills with honey .
Then , a group of eggs is deposited in a cavity in the beebread loaf and the egg compartment is closed .
The queen afterward keeps incubating and guarding her eggs like a mother hen , taking a sip from time to time from the rather liquid honey in her honey pots .
When the larvae hatch , they feed on the beebread , although they also receive extra honey meals from their mother .
She continues to add to the pollen supply as needed .
The larvae , kept warm by the queen , are full grown in about ten days .
Each now makes a tough , papery cocoon and pupates .
After another two weeks , the first young emerge , four to eight small daughters that begin to play the role of worker bees , collecting pollen and nectar in the field and caring for the new young generation while the queen retires to a life of egg laying .
The first worker bees do not mate or lay eggs ; ;
males and mating females do not emerge until later in the season .
The broods of workers that appear later tend to be bigger than the first ones , probably because they are better fed .
By the middle of the summer , many of the larvae apparently receive such a good diet that it is `` optimal '' , and it is then that young queens begin to appear .
Simultaneously , males or drones are produced , mostly from the unfertilized eggs of workers , although a few may be produced by the queen .
The young queens and drones leave the nest and mate , and after a short period of freedom , the fertilized young queens will begin to dig in for the winter .
It is an amazing fact that in some species this will happen while the summer is still in full swing , for instance , in August .
The temperature then is still very high .
At the old nest , the queen will in the early fall cease to lay the fertilized eggs that will produce females .
As a result , the proportion of males ( which leave the nest ) increases , and eventually the old colony will die out completely .
The nest itself , the structure that in some cases housed about 2,000 individuals when the season was at its peak , is now rapidly destroyed by the scavenging larvae of certain beetles and moths .
Not always , though , does the development of a bumblebee colony take place in the smooth fashion we have just described .
Some members of the bee family have become idlers , social parasites that live at the expense of their hardworking relatives .
Bumblebees can thus suffer severely from the onslaughts of Psithyrus , the `` cuckoo-bumblebee '' as it is called in some European countries .
Female individuals of Psithyrus look deceptively like the workers and queens of the bumblebees they victimize .
The one sure way to tell victim and villain apart is to examine the hind legs which in the case of the idler , Psithyrus , lack the pollen baskets -- naturally ! !
The female parasite spends much time in her efforts to find a nest of her host .
When she succeeds , she usually manages to slip in unobtrusively , to deposit an egg on a completed loaf of beebread before the bumblebees seal the egg compartment .
The hosts never seem to recognize that something is amiss , so that the compartment afterward is sealed normally .
Thus , the larvae of the intruder can develop at the expense of the rightful inhabitants and the store of beebread .
Later on , they and the mother Psithyrus are fed by the Bombus workers .
Worse still , in a number of cases it has been claimed that the Psithyrus female kills the Bombus queen .
But let us return , after this gruesome interlude , to our willow catkins in the spring ; ;
there are other wild bees that command our attention .
It is almost certain that some of these , usually a trifle smaller than the honeybees , are andrenas or mining bees .
There are about 200 different kinds of Andrena in Europe alone .
One of my favorites is A. armata , a species very common in England , where it is sometimes referred to as the lawn bee .
The females like to burrow in the short turf of well-kept lawns , where their little mounds of earth often appear by the hundreds .
Almost equal in size to a honeybee , A. armata is much more beautiful in color , at least in the female of the species : a rich , velvety , rusty red .
The males are much duller .
After having mated , an Andrena female digs a hole straight down into the ground , forming a burrow about the size of a lead pencil .
The bottom part of a burrow has a number of side tunnels or `` cells '' , each of which is provided with an egg plus a store of beebread .
The development of the Andrena larvae is very rapid , so that by the end of spring they have already pupated and become adults .
But they are still enclosed in their larval cells and remain there throughout the summer , fall , and winter .
Their appearance , next spring , coincides in an almost uncanny way with the flowering of their host plants .
In the Sacramento valley in California , for instance , it has been observed that there was not one day's difference between the emergence of the andrenas and the opening of the willow catkins .
This must be due to a completely identical response to the weather , in the plant and the animal .
After the male and female andrenas have mated , the cycle is repeated .
Although Andrena is gregarious , so that we may find hundreds and hundreds of burrows together , we must still call it a solitary bee .
Its life history is much simpler than that of the truly colonial bumblebees and can serve as an example of the life cycle of many other species .
After all , social life in the group of the bees is by no means general , although it certainly is a striking feature .
On the basis of its life history , we like to think that Andrena is more primitive than the bumblebees .
The way in which it transports its pollen is not so perfect , either .
It lacks pollen baskets and possesses only a large number of long , branched hairs on its legs , on which the pollen grains will collect .
Still Andrena will do a reasonably good job , so that an animal with a full pollen load looks like a gay little piece of yellow down floating in the wind .
Closely related to the andrenas are the nomias or alkali bees .
Nomia melanderi can be found in tremendous numbers in certain parts of the United States west of the Great Plains , for example , in Utah and central Washington .
In the United States Department of Agriculture's Yearbook Of Agriculture , 1952 , which is devoted entirely to insects , George E. Bohart mentions a site in Utah which was estimated to contain 200,000 nesting females .
Often the burrows are only an inch or two apart , and the bee cities cover several acres .
The life history of the alkali bee is similar to that of Andrena , but the first activity of the adults does not take place until summer , and the individuals hibernate in the prepupal stage .
In most places , there are two generations a year , a second brood of adults appearing late in the summer .
I must plead guilty to a special sympathy for nomias .
This may just be pride in my adopted State of Washington , but certainly I love to visit their mound cities near Yakima and Prosser in July or August , when the bees are in their most active period .
The name `` alkali bee '' indicates that one has to look for them in rather inhospitable places .
Sometimes , although by no means always , these are indeed alkaline .
The thing is that these bees love a fine-grained soil that is moist ; ;
yet the water in the ground should not be stagnant either .
They dislike dense vegetation .
Where does one find such conditions ? ?
The best chance , of course , is offered by gently sloping terrain where the water remains close to the surface and where the air is dry , so that a high evaporation leaves salty deposits which permit only sparse plant growth .
Many other ( probably nearly all ) snakes at maturity are already more than half their final length .
Laurence M. Klauber put length at maturity at two thirds the ultimate length for some rattlesnakes , and Charles C. Carpenter's data on Michigan garter and ribbon snakes ( Thamnophis ) show that the smallest gravid females are more than half as long as the biggest adults .
Felix Kopstein states that `` when the snake reaches its maturity it has already reached about its maximal length '' , but goes on to cite the reticulate python as an exception , with maximum length approximately three times that at maturity .
It is hard to understand how he concluded that most snakes do not grow appreciably after attaining maturity ; ;
he was working with species of Java , so perhaps some tropical snakes are unusual in this respect .
Certain individual giants recorded later did fail to show a reasonable difference after maturity , but it is impossible to know whether this is due to captive conditions .
Additional records of slow growth have been omitted .
It is possible to make a few generalizations about the six giants themselves .
There seems to be a rough correlation between the initial and ultimate lengths , starting with the smallest ( boa constrictor ) and ending with the largest ( anaconda ) .
Data on the former are scanty , but there can be little doubt that the latter is sometimes born at a length greater than that of any of the others , thereby lending support to the belief that the anaconda does , indeed , attain the greatest length .
For four of the six ( the anaconda and the amethystine python cannot be included for lack of data ) there is also a correlation between size at maturity and maximum length , the boa constrictor being the smallest and the Indian python the next in size at the former stage .
Let us speculate a little on the maximum size of the anaconda .
If , in a certain part of the range , it starts life 1 foot longer than do any of the other ( relatively large ) giants , and reaches maturity at , let us guess , 18 inches longer than the others , a quadrupling of the maturity length would result in a maximum of ( nearly ) 40 feet .
When it comes to rate of early growth , the Indian python leads with a figure of about 3 feet 6 inches per year for the first two years , more or less .
The African rock python , a close second , is followed in turn by the reticulate python .
There are few data on the boa constrictor , those for the anaconda are unconvincing , and there is nothing at all on the amethystine python .
It seems likely that the Indian python comes out ahead because records of its growth have been made more carefully and frequently ; ;
it responds exceptionally well to captivity and does not reach proportions that make it hard to keep .
I cannot make sense out of the figures for post maturity growth ; ;
at best the annual increase appears to be a matter of inches rather than feet .
Until better records have been kept over longer periods of time and much more is known about the maximum dimensions , it will be wise to refrain from drawing conclusions .
It is often stated that the largest snakes require five years to attain maturity , but this apparently is an overestimation .
The best way to determine the correct figure ( in captives ) is by direct observation of pairs isolated from birth , a method that produced surprising results : maturing of a male Indian python in less than two years , his mate in less than three ; ;
data on the boa constrictor about match this .
Another approach is to estimate from the rate of growth and the smallest size at maturity .
Results from this approach amply confirm the direct observations : about three years are required , there being a possible slight difference between males and females in the time required .
Only the amethystine python and the anaconda must be excluded for lack or paucity of data .
The following information on snakes varying greatly in size ( but all with less than a 10-foot maximum ) shows , when considered with the foregoing , that there is probably no correlation between the length of a snake and the time required for it to mature .
Oliver , in his summary of the habits of the snakes of the United States , could supply data on the maturing period for only three species in addition to the rattlers , which I shall consider separately .
These three were much alike : lined snake ( Tropidoclonion ) , one year and nine months ; ;
red-bellied snake ( Storeria ) , two years ; ;
cottonmouth ( Ancistrodon ) , two years .
Klauber investigated the rattlesnakes carefully himself and also summarized what others have found .
He concluded that in the southern species , which are rapidly growing types , females mate at the age of two and a half and bear the first young when they are three .
Other herpetologists have ascertained that in the northern United States the prairie rattlesnake may not give first birth until it is four or even five years old , and that the young may be born every other year , rather than annually .
Carpenter's study showed that female common garter and ribbon snakes of Michigan mature at about the age of two .
Maximum length
Oversized monsters are never brought home either alive or preserved , and field measurements are obviously open to doubt because of the universal tendency to exaggerate dimensions .
Measurements of skins are of little value ; ;
every snake hide is noticeably longer than its carcass and intentional stretching presents no difficulty to the unscrupulous explorer .
In spite of all the pitfalls , there is a certain amount of agreement on some of the giants .
The anaconda proves to be the fly in the ointment , but the reason for this is not clear ; ;
the relatively wild conditions still found in tropical South America might be responsible .
There are three levels on which to treat the subject .
The first is the strictly scientific , which demands concrete proof and therefore may err on the conservative side by waiting for evidence in the flesh .
This approach rejects virtually all field measurements .
The next level attempts to weigh varied evidence and come to a balanced , sensible conclusion ; ;
field measurements by experienced explorers are not rejected , and even reports of a less scientific nature are duly evaluated .
The third level leans on a belief that a lot of smoke means some fire .
The argument against this last approach is comparable to that which rejects stories about hoop snakes , about snakes that break themselves into many pieces and join up again , or even of ghosts that chase people out of graveyards ; ;
the mere piling up of testimony does not prove , to the scientific mind , the existence of hoop snakes , joint snakes , or ghosts .
Oliver has recently used the second-level approach with the largest snakes , and has come to these conclusions : the anaconda reaches a length of at least 37 feet , the reticulate python 33 , the African rock python 25 , the amethystine python at least 22 , the Indian python 20 , and the boa constrictor 18-1/2 .
Bernard Heuvelmans also treats of the largest snakes , but on the third level , and is chiefly concerned with the anaconda .
He reasons that as anacondas 30 feet long are often found , some might be 38 , and occasional `` monstrous freaks '' over 50 .
He rejects dimensions of 70 feet and more .
His thirteenth chapter includes many exciting accounts of huge serpents with prodigious strength , but these seem to be given to complete his picture , not to be believed .
Detailed information on record lengths of the giants is given in the section that follows .
Growth of the six giants
Discussions of the giants one by one will include , as far as possible , data on these aspects of growth : size at which life is started and at which sexual maturity is reached ; ;
time required to reach maturity ; ;
rate of growth both before and after this crucial stage ; ;
and maximum length , with confirmation or amplification of Oliver's figures .
Definite information on the growth of senile individuals is lacking .
Anaconda :
At birth , this species varies considerably in size .
A brood of twenty-eight born at Brookfield Zoo , near Chicago , ranged in length from 22 to 33-1/2 inches and averaged 29 inches .
Lawrence E. Griffin gives measurements of nineteen young anacondas , presumably members of a brood , from `` South America '' ; ;
the extreme measurements of these fall between the lower limit of the Brookfield brood and its average .
Raymond L. Ditmars had two broods that averaged 27 inches .
R. R. Mole and F. W. Urich give approximately 20 inches as the average length of a brood of thirty from the region of the Orinoco estuaries .
William Beebe reports 26 inches and 2.4 ounces ( this snake must have been emaciated ) for the length and the weight of a young anaconda from British Guiana .
In contrast , Ditmars recorded the average length of seventy-two young of a 19-foot female as 38 inches , and four young were born in London at a length of 35 or 36 inches and a weight of from 14 to 16 ounces .
Beebe had a 3-foot anaconda that weighed only 9.8 ounces .
A difference between subspecies might explain the great range in size .
I have little information on the anaconda's rate of growth .
Hans Schweizer had one that increased from 19-1/2 inches to 5 feet 3 inches in five years , and J. J. Quelch records a growth of from less than 4 feet to nearly 10 in about six years .
It is very unlikely that either of these anacondas was growing at a normal rate .
In 1948 , Afranio Do Amaral , the noted Brazilian herpetologist , wrote a technical paper on the giant snakes .
He concluded that the anaconda's maximum length is 12 or 13 ( perhaps 14 ) meters , which would approximate from 39 to 42 feet ( 14 meters is slightly less than 46 feet ) .
Thus , his estimate lies between Oliver's suggestion of at least 37 feet and the 50-foot `` monstrous freaks '' intimated by Heuvelmans .
The most convincing recent measurement of an anaconda was made in eastern Colombia by Roberto Lamon , a petroleum geologist of the Richmond Oil Company , and reported in 1944 by Emmett R. Dunn .
However , as a field measurement , it is open to question .
Oliver's 37-1/2 feet is partly based on this report and can be accepted as probable .
However , many herpetologists remain skeptical and would prefer a tentative maximum of about 30 feet .
It is possible that especially large anacondas will prove to belong to subspecies limited to a small area .
In snakes difference in size is a common characteristic of subspecies .
Boa constrictor :
A Colombian female's brood of sixteen boa constrictors born in the Staten Island Zoo averaged 20 inches .
This birth length seems to be typical .
When some thirteen records of newly and recently born individuals are collated , little or no correlation between length and distribution can be detected .
The range is from 14 to 25 inches ; ;
the former figure is based on a somewhat unusual birth of four by a Central American female ( see chapter on Laying , Brooding , Hatching , and Birth ) , the latter on a `` normal '' newly born individual .
However , as so many of the records are not certainly based on newborn snakes , these data must be taken tentatively ; ;
final conclusions will have to await the measurements of broods from definite localities .
Alphonse R. Hoge's measurements of several very young specimens from Brazil suggest that at birth the female is slightly larger than the male .
I have surprisingly little information on the size and age at maturity .
Carl Kauffeld has written to me of sexual activity in February 1943 of young born in March 1940 .
One female , collected on an island off the coast of Nicaragua , was gravid and measured 4 feet 8 inches from snout to vent ( her tail should be between 6 and 7 inches long ) .
The female from Central America which gave birth to four was only 3 feet 11 inches long .
What data there are on growth indicate considerable variation in rate ; ;
unfortunately , no one has kept complete records of one individual , whereas many have been made for a very short period of time .
The results are too varied to allow generalization .
The bronchus and pulmonary artery in this lung type maintain a close relationship throughout .
The pulmonary vein , however , without the limiting supportive tissue septa as in type 1 , , follows a more direct path to the hilum and does not maintain this close relationship ( figs. 8 , 22 ) .
Another marked difference is noted here .
The pulmonary artery , in addition to supplying the distal portion of the respiratory bronchiole , the alveolar duct , and the alveoli , continues on and directly supplies the thin pleura ( fig. 8 ) .
The bronchial artery , except for a small number of short branches in the hilum , contributes none of the pleural blood supply .
It does , as in type 1 , , supply the hilar lymph nodes , the pulmonary artery , the pulmonary vein , the bronchi , and the bronchioles -- terminating in a common capillary bed with the pulmonary artery at the level of the respiratory bronchiole .
No bronchial artery-pulmonary artery anastomoses were noted in this group .
Lung type 3 ( ( fig. 3 ) is to some degree a composite of types 1 , and 2 .
It is characterized by the presence of incompletely developed secondary lobules ; ;
well defined , but haphazardly arranged , interlobular septa and a thick , remarkably vascular pleura ( fig. 9 ) .
The most distal airways are similar to those found in type 1 , , being composed of numerous , apparently true terminal bronchioles and occasional , poorly developed respiratory bronchioles ( figs. 14 , 15 ) .
In this instance , because of incomplete septation , the secondary lobule does not constitute in itself what appears to be a small individual lung as in type 1 .
Air-drifts from one area to another are , therefore , conceivable .
Distally the bronchus is situated between a pulmonary artery on one side and a pulmonary vein on the other , as in type 1 ( ( fig. 24 ) .
This relationship , however , is not maintained centrally .
Here the pulmonary vein , as in type 2 , , is noted to draw away from the bronchus , and to follow a more direct , independent course to the hilum ( figs. 23 , 24 ) .
The bronchial artery in its course and distribution differs somewhat from that found in other mammals .
As seen in types 1 , and 2 , , it supplies the hilar lymph nodes , vasa vasorum to the pulmonary artery and vein , the bronchi and the terminal bronchioles .
As in type 1 , , it provides arterial blood to the interlobular septa , and an extremely rich anastomotic pleural supply is seen ( figs. 9 , 10 ) .
This pleural supply is derived both from hilar and interlobular bronchial artery branches .
Such a dual derivation was strikingly demonstrated during the injection process where initial filling would be noted to occur in several isolated pleural vessels at once .
Some of these were obviously filling from interlobular branches of the bronchial arteries while others were filling from direct hilar branches following along the pleural surface .
With completion of filling , net-like anastomoses were noted to be present between these separately derived branches .
An unusual increase in the number of bronchial arteries present within the substance of the lung was noted .
This was accounted for primarily by the presence of a bronchial artery closely following the pulmonary artery .
The diameter of this bronchial artery was much too large for it to be a mere vasa vasorum ( figs. 16 , 23 , 24 ) .
In distal regions its diameter would be one-fourth to one-fifth that of the pulmonary artery .
This vessel could be followed to the parenchyma where it directly provided bronchial arterial blood to the alveolar capillary bed ( figs. 17 , 18 ) .
Also three other direct pathways of alveolar bronchial arterial supply were noted : via the pleura ; ;
through the interlobular septa ; ;
and along the terminal bronchiole ( figs. 14 , 17 , 18 , 19 ) .
One bronchial arteriolar-pulmonary arteriolar anastomosis was noted at the terminal bronchiolar level ( fig. 26 ) .
Discussion
It is evident that many marked and striking differences exist between lungs when an inter-species comparison is made .
The significance of these differences has not been studied nor has the existence of corresponding physiologic differences been determined .
However , the dynamics of airflow , from morphologic considerations alone , may conceivably be different in the monkey than in the horse .
The volume and , perhaps , even the characteristics of bronchial arterial blood flow might be different in the dog than in the horse .
Also , interlobular air drifts may be all but nonexistent in the cow ; ;
probably occur in the horse much as in the human being ; ;
and , in contrast , are present to a relatively immense degree on a segmental basis in the dog where lobules are absent ( Van Allen and Lindskog , '31 ) .
A reason for such wide variation in the pulmonary morphology is entirely lacking at present .
Within certain wide limits anatomy dictates function and , if one is permitted to speculate , potential pathology should be included in this statement as well .
For example , the marked susceptibility of the monkey to respiratory infection might be related to its delicate , long alveolar ducts and short , large bronchioles situated within a parenchyma entirely lacking in protective supportive tissue barriers such as those found in types 1 , and 3 .
One might also wonder if monkeys are capable of developing bronchiolitis as we know it in man or the horse .
In addition , it would be difficult to imagine chronic generalized emphysema occurring in a cow , considering its marked lobular development but , conversely , not difficult to imagine this occurring in the horse or the dog .
Anatomically , the horse lung appears to be remarkably like that of man , insofar as this can be ascertained from comparison of our findings in the horse with those of others ( Birnbaum , '54 ) in the human being .
The only area in which one might find major disagreement in this matter is in regard to the alveolar distribution of the bronchial arteries .
As early as 1858 , Le Fort claimed an alveolar distribution of the bronchial arteries in human beings .
In 1951 , this was reaffirmed by Cudkowicz .
The opposition to this point of view has its staunchest support in the work of Miller ( '50 ) .
Apparently , however , Miller has relied heavily on the anatomy in dogs and cats , and he has been criticized for using pathologic human material in his normal study ( Loosli , '38 ) .
Although Miller noted in 1907 that a difference in the pleural blood supply existed between animals , nowhere in his published works is it found that he did a comparative study of the intrapulmonary features of various mammalian lungs other than in the dog and cat ( Miller , '13 ; ;
'25 ) .
The meaning of this variation in distribution of the bronchial artery as found in the horse is not clear .
However , this artery is known to be a nutrient vessel with a distribution primarily to the proximal airways and supportive tissues of the lung .
The alveoli and respiratory bronchioles are primarily diffusing tissues .
Theoretically , they are capable of extracting their required oxygen either from the surrounding air ( Ghoreyeb and Karsner , '13 ) or from pulmonary arterial blood ( Comroe , '58 ) .
Therefore , an explanation of this alveolar bronchial artery supply might be the nutritive requirement of an increased amount of supportive tissue , not primarily diffusing in nature , in the region of the alveolus .
If this be true , the possibility exists that an occlusive lesion of the bronchial arteries might cause widespread degeneration of supportive tissue similar to that seen in generalized emphysema .
One would not expect such an event to occur in animals possessing lungs of types 1 , or 2 .
The presence of normally occurring bronchial artery-pulmonary artery anastomoses was first noted in 1721 by Ruysch , and thereafter by many others .
Nakamura ( '58 ) , Verloop ( '48 ) , Marchand , Gilroy and Watson ( '50 ) , Von Hayek ( '53 ) , and Tobin ( '52 ) have all claimed their normal but relatively nonfunctional existence in the human being .
Miller ( '50 ) is the principal antagonist of this viewpoint .
In criticism of the latter's views , his conclusions were based upon dog lung injection studies in which all of the vascular channels were first filled with a solution under pressure and then were injected with various sized colored particles designed to stop at the arteriolar level .
As early as 1913 Ghoreyeb and Karsner demonstrated with perfusion studies in dogs that bronchial artery flow would remain constant at a certain low level when pressure was maintained in the pulmonary artery and vein , but that increases in bronchial artery flow would occur in response to a relative drop in pulmonary artery pressure .
Berry , Brailsford and Daly in 1931 and Nakamura in 1958 reaffirmed this .
Our own studies in which bronchial artery-pulmonary artery anastomoses were demonstrated , were accomplished by injecting the bronchial artery first with no pressure on the pulmonary artery or vein , and then by injecting the pulmonary artery and vein afterwards .
It is distinctly possible , therefore , that simultaneous pressures in all three vessels would have rendered the shunts inoperable and hence , uninjectable .
This viewpoint is further supported by Verloop's ( '48 ) demonstration of thickened bronchial artery and arteriolar muscular coats which are capable of acting as valves .
In other words , the anastomoses between the bronchial artery and pulmonary artery should be considered as functional or demand shunts .
In addition , little work has been done on a comparative basis in regard to the normal existence of bronchial artery-pulmonary artery anastomoses .
Verloop ( '48 ; ;
'49 ) found these shunts in the human being but was unable to find them in rats .
Ellis , Grindlay and Edwards ( '52 ) also were unable to find them in rats .
Nakamura ( '58 ) was unable to demonstrate their existence , either by anatomic or physiologic methods , in dogs .
The possibility that the absence or presence of these shunts is species-dependent is therefore inferred .
Certainly , the mere fact of failing to demonstrate them in one or another species does not conclusively deny their existence in that species .
It is , however , highly suggestive and agrees well with our own findings in which we also failed to demonstrate normally occurring bronchial artery-pulmonary artery shunts in certain species , especially the dog .
In conclusion , these findings suggest the need for a comparative physiology , pathology , and histology of mammalian lungs .
In addition , a detailed interspecies survey of the incidence of generalized pulmonary emphysema in mammals would be interesting and pertinent .
Also , for the present , great caution should be exercised in the choice of an experimental animal for pulmonary studies if they are to be applied to man .
This is especially so if the dog , cat or monkey are to be used , in view of their marked anatomical differences from man .
Finally , it is suggested that in many respects the horse lung may be anatomically more comparable to that of the human than any other presently known species .
Summary
The main subgross anatomical features of the lungs of various mammals are presented .
A tabulation of these features permits the lungs to be grouped into three distinctive subgross types .
Type 1 , is represented by the cow , sheep , and pig ; ;
type 2 , , by the dog , cat , and monkey ; ;
type 3 , , by the horse .
Lobularity is extremely well developed in type 1 ; ;
absent in type 2 ; ;
imperfectly developed in type 3 .
The pleura and interlobular septa are thick in types 1 and 3 .
The pleura is extremely thin in type 2 and septa are absent .
Arterial supply to the pleura in types 1 and 3 is provided by the bronchial artery , and in type 2 , by the pulmonary artery .
In types 1 , 2 and 3 the bronchial artery terminates in a capillary bed shared in common with the pulmonary artery at the level of the distal bronchiole .
In type 3 the bronchial artery also provides blood directly to the alveolar capillary bed .
True terminal bronchioles comprise the most frequent form taken by the distal airways in types 1 and 3 , although small numbers of poorly developed respiratory bronchioles are present .
Well developed respiratory bronchioles , on the other hand , appear to be the only form taken by the distal airways in type 2 .
In type 1 the pulmonary vein closely follows the course of the bronchus and the pulmonary artery from the periphery to the hilum .
This may be due to the heavy interlobular connective tissue barriers present .
In type 3 , this general relationship is maintained peripherally but not centrally where the pulmonary vein follows a more independent path to the hilum as is the case throughout the lung in type 2 .
Some of the features of the top portions of Figure 1 and Figure 2 were mentioned in discussing Table 1 .
First , the Onset Profile spreads across approximately 12 years for boys and 10 years for girls .
In contrast , 20 of the 21 lines in the Completion Profile ( excluding center 5 for boys and 4 for girls ) are bunched and extend over a much shorter period , approximately 30 months for boys and 40 months for girls .
The Maturity Chart for each sex demonstrates clearly that Onset is a phenomenon of infancy and early childhood whereas Completion is a phenomenon of the later portion of adolescence .
Second , for both sexes , the 21 transverse lines in the Onset Profile vary more in individual spread than those in the Completion Profile .
Although the standard deviation values on which spread of the lines is based are relatively larger for those centers which begin to ossify early ( Table 1 ) , there are considerable differences in this value between centers having the closely timed Onsets .
Third , the process of calcification is seen to begin later and to continue much longer for these boys than for the girls , a fact which confirms data for other groups of children .
The Onset Profile and Completion Profile are constructed to serve as norms for children .
It is convenient to classify a child's onset ages and completion ages as `` advanced '' , `` moderate '' ( modal ) , or `` delayed '' according to whether the child's age equivalent `` dots '' appeared to the left of , upon , or to the right of the appropriate short transverse line .
When a dot appears close to the end of the transverse line , the `` moderate '' rating may be further classified according to the position of the dot with respect to the vertical marking denoting the mean age .
Such classifications may be called `` somewhat advanced '' or `` somewhat delayed '' , as the case may be , reserving `` moderate '' for dots upon or close to the mean .
In the lower portion of each Chart , the Skeletal Age ( Hand ) of boy 34 and girl 2 may be similarly classified .
There the middle one of the three curves denotes `` mean Skeletal Age '' for the Maturity Series boys and girls .
The upper curve denotes the mean plus one standard deviation , and the lower curve represents the mean minus one standard deviation .
Thus , a child's Skeletal Age `` dots '' may be classified as `` advanced '' when they appear above the middle curve , `` moderate '' when they appear immediately above or below the middle curve , and `` delayed '' when they appear below the lower curve .
To summarize the purpose of the Skeletal Maturity Chart : each contains two kinds of skeletal maturity norms which show two quite different methods of depicting developmental level of growth centers .
First , the upper portion requires series of films for every child , consisting of those from Hand , Elbow , Shoulder , Knee , and Foot .
The lower portion necessitates only films of Hand .
Second , the upper portion permits comparison of maturity levels of an equal number of growth centers from the long , short , and round bones of the five regions .
The lower portion permits comparison of maturity levels of short and round bones predominantly , since only two long bones are included in Hand and Wrist as a region .
Third , the upper portion deals with only two indicators of developmental level , Onset and Completion .
The lower portion utilizes the full complement of intermediate maturity indicators of each Hand center as well as their Onset and Completion .
Fourth , the two indicators are for the most part widely separated chronologically , with the extensive age gap occurring during childhood for all but one growth center .
The lower portion provides a rating at any stage between infancy and adulthood .
Onsets , Completions , and Skeletal Ages ( Hand ) of boy 34 and girl 2 may be directly compared and classified , using only those Skeletal Ages which appear immediately below the Onset Profile and the Completion Profile .
It may be assumed that differences in ratings due to selection of growth centers from specific regions of the body will be small , according to existing tables of onset age and completion age for centers throughout the body .
Accordingly , maturity level ratings by means of the upper portion and lower portion of the Chart , respectively , should be somewhat similar since Skeletal Age assessments are dependent upon Onsets during infancy and upon Completions during adolescence .
It is clear that there are some differences in the ratings , but there is substantial agreement .
Since a Skeletal Age rating can be made at any age during growth , from Elbow , Shoulder , Knee , or Foot as well as Hand , it seems to be the method of choice when one wishes to study most aspects of skeletal developmental progress during childhood .
As stated earlier in the paper , Onsets and Completions -- particularly the former -- provide a different tool or indicator of expectancy in osseous development , each within a limited age period .
Such an indicator , or indicators , are needed as means of recognizing specific periods of delay in skeletal developmental progress .
It was stated earlier that one purpose of this study was to extend the analysis of variability of Onset and Completion in each of the 21 growth centers somewhat beyond that provided by the data in Tables 1 and 2 .
As one approach to doing this , Figures 3 and 4 have be constructed from the mean ages and the individual onset and completion ages for boy 34 and girl 2 .
The differences between onset age and completion age with respect to the corresponding mean age have been brought into juxtaposition by means of a series of arrows .
The data for boy 34 appear in Figure 3 , and for girl 2 in Figure 4 .
The numbering system used in Tables 1 and 2 and Figures 1 and 2 was continued for the 21 growth centers .
The `` dot '' on one end of each arrow indicates extent of difference in months between the child's onset age and the corresponding mean age for the growth center .
The `` tip '' of the arrow represents extent of difference between the child's completion age and the corresponding mean age for the growth center .
Thus , the alignment of the `` dots '' and `` tips '' , respectively , indicate individual variability of the 21 growth centers of each child with respect to the mean values for these boys and girls .
The direction in which the arrow points shows how the maturity level of the growth center was changed at Completion from the level at Onset .
When the `` dot '' and `` tip '' coincide , the classification used in this paper is `` Same schedule '' .
The length of the arrow indicates amount of slowing or acceleration at Completion over that at Onset , and the difference in months can be read roughly by referring the arrow to the age scale along the base of each figure , or more precisely by referring to the original data in the appropriate tables .
The difference between the sequence of Onset of ossification for the sexes governs the numbering sequence in Figures 3 and 4 .
This difference is readily clarified by referring to Table 1 .
For example , arrow 17 in Figure 3 portrays the proximal radial epiphysis for boy 34 , whereas the same epiphysis for girl 2 is portrayed by arrow 18 in Figure 4 .
For the boy , this epiphysis was markedly delayed at Onset but near the mean at Completion .
Thus , the Span of its ossification was shortened and the center's ability to `` catch up '' in ossification is demonstrated .
In contrast , for the girl the epiphysis was slightly advanced at Onset and delayed at Completion .
Obviously , the slowing for her may have occurred at any point between Onset and Completion .
The Skeletal Age curve in the lower portion of Figure 2 shows that slowing may have occurred for her during the prepubescent period .
Length of the shaft of these arrows may be evaluated according to the standard deviation values for each center in Table 1 .
We have attempted to simplify the extensive task of analyzing onset ages and completion ages of each child -- more than 1700 values for the entire group -- by constructing figures for each of the 21 centers so that the data for all 34 boys and 34 of the girls will appear together for each growth center .
Figures 5 and 6 are examples of our method of analyzing the results for each growth center .
Forty other figures similar to 5 and 6 and the original data used in the construction of all figures and tables in this monograph have been included in the Appendix .
The principles used in making each arrow for Figures 3 and 4 were applied to the construction of Figures 5 and 6 as well as all figures in the Appendix .
One growth center in a short bone -- distal phalanx of the second finger -- was chosen as an example for discussion here , primarily because epiphyseal-diaphyseal fusion , the maturity indicator for Completion in long and short bones , occurs in this center for girls near the menarche and for boys near their comparable pubescent stage .
Its Completion thus becomes one of the convenient maturity indicators to include in studies of growth , dietary patterns , and health during adolescence .
The following summary , based on Figures 5 and 6 , is an example of one way of interpreting the 42 figures constructed from onset ages and completion ages of individual children with respect to the appropriate mean age for each growth center .
At the top of Figure 5 , for example , the Onset range and Completion range lines for the chosen growth center have been drawn for girls according to their mean and standard deviation values in Table 1 .
The 34 arrows , denoting onset age plus completion age deviations , have been arrayed in an Onset sequence which begins with girl 18 who had the earliest Onset of the 34 girls .
The growth center depicted here , in the distal phalanx of the second finger , is listed as the fifth of those in the seven short bones .
The mean onset age was 25.3 months ( Table 1 ) , and the average Span of the osseous stage was 133 months .
The correlation ( Table 2 ) between onset age and completion age was -.50 , and that between onset age and Span was -.10 .
With due consideration for the limits of precision in assessing , expected rate of change in ossification of girls age 2 years , and the known variations in rate of ossification of these children as described in our preceding paper in the Supplement , each arrow with a `` shaft length '' of four months or less was selected as indicating `` same schedule '' at Onset and Completion , for this particular epiphysis .
Accordingly , girls 31 , 29 , 33 , 21 , 26 , 13 , 3 , 4 , 14 , 32 , 24 , 25 , 34 , 23 , 6 , 15 , 22 , and 16 may be said to have the `` same schedule '' at Onset and Completion .
It seems clear , from the counter-balanced shape of the series of arrows in Figure 5 that there was about an equal number of early and late Onsets and Completions for the 34 girls .
Accordingly , if epiphyseal-diaphyseal fusion occurs in this phalanx near menarche , early and late menarches might have been forecast rather precisely at the time of Onset of ossification for the 18 girls with `` same schedule '' .
As an example of the interpretation of an arrow in the figure which exceeds four months in shaft length in conjunction with its position in the figure : girl 2 had a delayed Onset and further delayed Completion .
It is of interest that her menarche was somewhat later than the average for the girls in this group .
A similar analysis of Figure 6 for the 34 boys would necessitate quite a different conclusion about the predictive value of onset age in forecasting their attainment of the pubescent stage .
Boys 32 , 23 , 31 , 17 , 30 , 19 , and 24 had `` same schedule '' at Onset and Completion ; ;
thus early forecasting of the pubescent stage would appear possible for only seven boys .
Boy 34 , like girl 2 , did not have `` same schedule '' ; ;
his arrow crosses the line denoting the mean .
The `` dot '' on his arrow indicates early Onset and the `` tip '' indicates relatively later Completion .
After the 42 figures had been drawn like Figures 5 and 6 , classifications of the onset ages and completion ages were summarized from them .
Interestingly enough , the effect of the digitalis glycosides is inhibited by a high concentration of potassium in the incubation medium and is enhanced by the absence of potassium ( Wolff , 1960 ) .
B .
Organification of iodine
The precise mechanism for organification of iodine in the thyroid is not as yet completely understood .
However , the formation of organically bound iodine , mainly mono-iodotyrosine , can be accomplished in cell-free systems .
In the absence of additions to the homogenate , the product formed is an iodinated particulate protein ( Fawcett and Kirkwood , 1953 ; ;
Taurog , Potter and Chaikoff , 1955 ; ;
Taurog , Potter , Tong , and Chaikoff , 1956 ; ;
Serif and Kirkwood , 1958 ; ;
De Groot and Carvalho , 1960 ) .
This iodoprotein does not appear to be the same as what is normally present in the thyroid , and there is no evidence so far that thyroglobulin can be iodinated in vitro by cell-free systems .
In addition , the iodoamino acid formed in largest quantity in the intact thyroid is di-iodotyrosine .
If tyrosine and a system generating hydrogen peroxide are added to a cell-free homogenate of the thyroid , large quantities of free mono-iodotyrosine can be formed ( Alexander , 1959 ) .
It is not clear whether this system bears any resemblance to the in vivo iodinating mechanism , and a system generating peroxide has not been identified in thyroid tissue .
On chemical grounds it seems most likely that iodide is first converted to Af and then to Af as the active iodinating species .
In the thyroid gland it appears that proteins ( chiefly thyroglobulin ) are iodinated and that free tyrosine and thyronine are not iodinated .
Iodination of tyrosine , however , is not enough for the synthesis of hormone .
The mono- and di-iodotyrosine must be coupled to form tri-iodothyronine and thyroxine .
The mechanism of this coupling has been studied in some detail with non-enzymatic systems in vitro and can be simulated by certain di-iodotyrosine analogues ( Pitt-Rivers and James , 1958 ) .
There is so far no evidence to indicate conclusively that this coupling is under enzymatic control .
The chemical nature of the iodocompounds is discussed below ( pp. 76 et seq. ) .
C .
Thyroglobulin synthesis
Little is known of the synthetic mechanisms for formation of thyroglobulin .
Its synthesis has not been demonstrated in cell-free systems , nor has its synthesis by systems with intact thyroid cells in vitro been unequivocally proven .
There is some reason to think that thyroglobulin synthesis may proceed independently of iodination , for in certain transplantable tumours of the rat thyroid containing essentially no iodinated thyroglobulin , a protein that appears to be thyroglobulin has been observed in ultracentrifuge experiments ( Wolff , Robbins and Rall , 1959 ) .
Similar findings have been noted in a patient with congenital absence of the organification enzymes , whose thyroid tissue could only concentrate iodide .
In addition , depending on availability of dietary iodine , thyroglobulin may contain varying quantities of iodine .
D .
Secretion
Since the circulating thyroid hormones are the amino acids thyroxine and tri-iodothyronine ( cf. Section C ) , it is clear that some mechanism must exist in the thyroid gland for their release from proteins before secretion .
The presence of several proteases and peptidases has been demonstrated in the thyroid .
One of the proteases has pH optimum of about 3.7 and another of about 5.7 ( McQuillan , Stanley and Trikojus , 1954 ; ;
Alpers , Robbins and Rall , 1955 ) .
The finding that the concentration of one of these proteases is increased in thyroid glands from TSH-treated animals suggests that this protease may be active in vivo .
There is no conclusive evidence yet that either of the proteases has been prepared in highly purified form nor is their specificity known .
A study of their activity on thyroglobulin has shown that thyroxine is not preferentially released and that the degradation proceeds stepwise with the formation of macromolecular intermediates ( Alpers , Petermann and Rall , 1956 ) .
Besides proteolytic enzymes the thyroid possesses de-iodinating enzymes .
A microsomal de-iodinase with a pH optimum of around 8 , and requiring reduced triphosphopyridine nucleotide for activity , has been identified in the thyroid ( Stanbury , 1957 ) .
This de-iodinating enzyme is effective against mono- and di-iodotyrosine , but does not de-iodinate thyroxine or tri-iodothyronine .
It is assumed that the iodine released from the iodotyrosines remains in the iodide pool of the thyroid , where it is oxidised and re-incorporated into thyroglobulin .
The thyroxine and tri-iodothyronine released by proteolysis and so escaping de-iodination presumably diffuse into the blood stream .
It has been shown that thyroglobulin binds thyroxine , but the binding does not appear to be particularly strong .
It has been suggested that the plasma thyroxine-binding proteins , which have an extremely high affinity for thyroxine , compete with thyroglobulin for thyroxine ( Ingbar and Freinkel , 1957 ) .
E .
Antithyroid drugs
Antithyroid drugs are of two general types .
One type has a small univalent anion of the thiocyanate-perchlorate-fluoro type .
This ion inhibits thyroid hormone synthesis by interfering with iodide concentration in the thyroid .
It does not appear to affect the iodinating mechanism as such .
The other group of antithyroid agents or drugs is typified by thiouracil .
These drugs have no effect on the iodide concentrating mechanism , but they inhibit organification .
The mechanism of action of these drugs has not been completely worked out , but certain of them appear to act by reducing the oxidised form of iodine before it can iodinate thyroglobulin ( Astwood , 1954 ) .
On the other hand , there are a few antithyroid drugs of this same general type , such as resorcinol , possessing no reducing activity and possibly acting through formation of a complex with molecular iodine .
Any of the antithyroid drugs , of either type , if given in large enough doses for a long period of time will cause goitre , owing to inhibition of thyroid hormone synthesis , with production of hypothyroidism .
The anterior lobe of the pituitary then responds by an increased output of TSH , causing the thyroid to enlarge .
The effect of drugs that act on the iodide-concentrating mechanism can be counteracted by addition of relatively large amounts of iodine to the diet .
The antithyroid drugs of the thiouracil type , however , are not antagonised by such means .
Besides those of the thiouracil and resorcinol types , certain antithyroid drugs have been found in naturally occurring foods .
The most conclusively identified is L-5-vinyl-2-thio-oxazolidone , which was isolated from rutabaga ( Greer , 1950 ) .
It is presumed to occur in other members of the Brassica family .
There is some evidence that naturally occurring goitrogens may play a role in the development of goitre , particularly in Tasmania and Australia ( Clements and Wishart , 1956 ) .
There it seems that the goitrogen ingested by dairy animals is itself inactive but is converted in the animal to an active goitrogen , which is then secreted in the milk .
F .
Dietary influences
Besides the presence of goitrogens in the diet , the level of iodine itself in the diet plays a major role in governing the activity of the thyroid gland .
In the experimental animal and in man gross deficiency in dietary iodine causes thyroid hyperplasia , hypertrophy and increased thyroid activity ( Money , Rall and Rawson , 1952 ; ;
Stanbury , Brownell , Riggs , Perinetti , Itoiz , and Del Castillo , 1954 ) .
In man the normal level of iodine in the diet and the level necessary to prevent development of goitre is about 100 **ymg per day .
With lower levels , thyroid hypertrophy and increased thyroid blood-flow enable the thyroid to accumulate a larger proportion of the daily intake of iodine .
Further , the gland is able to re-use a larger fraction of the thyroid hormone de-iodinated peripherally .
In the presence of a low iodine intake , thyroglobulin labelled in vivo with Af is found to contain more mono-iodotyrosine than normal , the amounts of di-iodotyrosine and iodothyronines being correspondingly reduced .
This appears to result from both a reduced amount of the iodine substrate and a more rapid secretion of newly iodinated thyroglobulin .
If the deficiency persists long enough , it is reasonable to suppose that the Af label will reflect the Af distribution in the thyroglobulin .
Similar results might be expected from the influence of drugs or pathological conditions that limit iodide trapping , or organification , or accelerate thyroglobulin proteolysis .
B .
The thyroid-stimulating hormone
The name thyroid-stimulating hormone ( TSH ) has been given to a substance found in the anterior pituitary gland of all species of animal so tested for its presence .
The hormone has also been called thyrotrophin or thyrotrophic hormone .
At the present time we do not know by what biochemical mechanism TSH acts on the thyroid , but for bio-assay of the hormone there are a number of properties by which its activity may be estimated , including release of iodine from the thyroid , increase in thyroid weight , increase in mean height of the follicular cells and increase in the thyroidal uptake of Af .
Here we shall restrict discussion to those methods that appear sufficiently sensitive and precise for determining the concentration of TSH in blood .
Brown ( 1959 ) has reviewed generally the various methods of assaying TSH , and the reader is referred to her paper for further information on the subject .

Chemical constitution and physical properties of pituitary tsh
As long ago as 1851 it was pointed out by Niepce ( 1851 ) that there is a connection between the pituitary and the thyroid .
This connection was clarified by Smith and Smith ( 1922 ) , who showed that saline extracts of fresh bovine pituitary glands could re-activate the atrophied thyroids of hypophysectomised tadpoles .
The first attempts to isolate TSH came a decade later , when Janssen and Loeser ( 1931 ) used trichloroacetic acid to separate the soluble TSH from insoluble impurities .
After their work other investigators applied salt-fractionation techniques to the problem , as well as fractionation with organic solvents , such as acetone .
Albert ( 1949 ) has concluded that the most active preparations of TSH made during this period , from 1931 to 1945 , were probably about 100 to 300 times as potent as the starting material .
Much of this work has been reviewed by White ( 1944 ) and by Albert ( 1949 ) .
Developments up to about 1957 have been discussed by Sonenberg ( 1958 ) .
In the last few years , the application of chromatographic and other modern techniques to the problem of isolating TSH has led to further purification ( Bates and Condliffe , 1960 ; ;
Pierce , Carsten and Wynston , 1960 ) .
The most active preparations obtained by these two groups of investigators appear to be similar in potency , composition and physical properties .
Two problems present themselves in considering any hormone in blood .
First , is the circulating form of the hormone the same as that found in the gland where it is synthesised and stored ? ?
Second , what is its concentration in normal circumstances and in what circumstances will this concentration depart from the normal level and in which direction ? ?
It is therefore necessary to consider the properties of pituitary TSH if the fragmentary chemical information about blood TSH is to be discussed rationally .
The importance of knowing in what chemical forms the hormone may exist is accentuated by the recent observation that there exists an abnormally long-acting TSH in blood drawn from many thyrotoxic patients ( Adams , 1958 ) .
Whether this abnormal TSH differs chemically from pituitary TSH , or is , alternatively , normal TSH with its period of effectiveness modified by some other blood constituent , cannot be decided without chemical study of the activity in the blood of these patients and a comparison of the substance responsible for the blood activity with pituitary Aj .
In evaluating data on the concentration of TSH in blood , one must examine critically the bio-assay methods used to obtain them .
The introduction of the United States Pharmacopoeia reference standard in 1952 and the redefinition and equating of the USP and international units of thyroid-stimulating activity have made it possible to compare results published by different investigators since that time .
We should like to re-emphasise the importance of stating results solely in terms of international units of TSH activity and of avoiding the re-introduction of biological units .
For the most part , this discussion will be confined to results obtained since the introduction of the reference standard .
A .
Standard preparations and units of thyroid-stimulating activity
The international unit ( u. ) , adopted to make possible the comparison of results from different laboratories ( Mussett and Perry , 1955 ) , has been defined as the amount of activity present in 13.5 mg of the International Standard Preparation .
The international unit is equipotent with the USP unit adopted in 1952 , which was defined as the amount of activity present in 20 mg of the USP reference substance .
Introduction
Muscle weakness is now recognized as an uncommon though serious complication of steroid therapy , with most of the synthetic adrenal corticosteroids in clinical use .
Although biopsies have shown structural changes in some of the reported cases of steroid-induced weakness , this case provides the only example known to us in which necropsy afforded the opportunity for extensive study of multiple muscle groups .
The case described in this paper is that of an older man who developed disabling muscular weakness while receiving a variety of steroids for a refractory anemia .
Report of case
This patient was a 65-year-old white male accountant who entered the New York Hospital for his fourth and terminal admission on June 26 , 1959 , because of disabling weakness and general debility .
In 1953 the patient developed an unexplained anemia for which 15 blood transfusions were given over a period of 4 years .
Splenomegaly was first noted in 1956 , and a sternal marrow biopsy at that time showed `` scattered foci of fibrosis '' suggestive of myelofibrosis .
No additional transfusions were necessary after the institution of prednisone in July , 1957 , in an initial dose of 40 mg. daily with gradual tapering to 10 mg. daily .
This medication was continued until February , 1958 .
In February , 1958 , the patient suffered a myocardial infarction complicated by pulmonary edema .
Additional findings at this time included cardiomegaly , peripheral arteriosclerosis obliterans , and cholelithiasis .
The hemoglobin was 11.6 gm. .
Therapy included digitalization and anticoagulation .
Later , chlorothiazide and salt restriction became necessary to control the edema of chronic congestive failure .
Because of increasing anemia , triamcinolone , 8 mg. daily , was started on Feb. 23 , 1958 , and was continued until July , 1958 .
In September , 1958 , the patient developed generalized weakness and fatigue which was concurrent with exacerbation of his anemia ; ;
the hemoglobin was 10.6 gm. .
In an attempt to reverse the downhill trend by stimulating the bone marrow and controlling any hemolytic component , triamcinolone , 16 mg. daily , was begun on Sept. 26 , 1958 , and continued until Feb. 18 , 1959 .
At first the patient felt stronger , and the hemoglobin rose to 13.8 gm. , but on Oct. 20 , 1958 , he complained of `` caving in '' in his knees .
By Nov. 8 , 1958 , weakness , specifically involving the pelvic and thigh musculature , was pronounced , and a common complaint was `` difficulty in stepping up on to curbs '' .
Prednisone , 30 mg. daily , was substituted for triamcinolone from Nov. 22 until Dec. 1 , 1958 , without any improvement in the weakness .
Serum potassium at this time was 3.8 mEq. per liter , and the hemoglobin was 13.9 gm. By Dec. 1 , 1958 , the weakness in the pelvic and quadriceps muscle groups was appreciably worse , and it became difficult for the patient to rise unaided from a sitting or reclining position .
Triamcinolone , 16 mg. daily , was resumed and maintained until Feb. 18 , 1959 .
Chlorothiazide was omitted for a 2-week period , but there was no change in the muscle weakness .
At this time a detailed neuromuscular examination revealed diffuse muscle atrophy that was moderate in the hands and feet , but marked in the shoulders , hips , and pelvic girdle , with hypoactive deep-tendon reflexes .
No fasciculations or sensory defects were found .
Electromyography revealed no evidence of lower motor neuron disease .
Thyroid function tests yielded normal results .
The protein-bound iodine was 6.6 mg. , and the radioactive iodine uptake over the thyroid gland was 46% in 24 hours , with a conversion ratio of 12% .
A Schilling test demonstrated normal absorption of vitamin Af .
In February , 1959 , during the second admission to The New York Hospital , a biopsy specimen of the left gastrocnemius showed striking increase in the sarcolemmal sheath nuclei and shrunken muscle fibers in several sections .
Serial serum potassium levels remained normal ; ;
the serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase was 10 units per ml. per min. .
The clinical impression at this time was either muscular dystrophy or polymyositis .
On Feb. 12 , 1959 , purified corticotropin ( ACTH Gel ) , 20 units daily intramuscularly , was started but had to be discontinued 3 weeks later because of excessive fluid retention .
From March 3 to May 1 , 1949 , the patient was maintained on dexamethasone , 3 to 6 mg. daily .
In May 1959 , prednisone , 30 mg. daily , replaced the dexamethasone .
Muscle weakness did not improve , and the patient needed first a cane , then crutches .
In spite of normal thyroid function tests , a trial of propylthiouracil , 400 mg. daily for one week , was given but served only to intensify muscle weakness .
Repeated attempts to withdraw steroids entirely were unsuccessful because increased muscle weakness resulted , as well as fever , malaise , anorexia , anxiety , and an exacerbation of the anemia .
These reactions were interpreted as being manifestations of hypoadrenocorticism .
Severe back pain in June , 1959 , prompted a third hospital admission .
Extensive osteoporosis with partial collapse of D8 was found .
A high-protein diet , calcium lactate supplements , and norethandrolone failed to change the skeletal complaint or the severe muscle weakness .
The terminal hospital admission on June 27 , 1959 , was necessitated by continued weakness and debility complicated by urinary retention and painful thrombosed hemorrhoids .
X-ray films of the vertebral column showed progression of the demineralization .
On July 4 , 1959 , the patient developed marked abdominal pain and distension , went into shock , and died .
Findings at necropsy
The body was that of a well-developed , somewhat debilitated white man weighing 108 lb. .
There were bilateral pterygia and arcus senilis , and the mouth was edentulous .
The heart weighed 510 gm. , and at the outflow tracts the left and right ventricles measured 19 and 3 mm. , respectively .
The coronary arteries were sclerotic and diffusely narrowed throughout their courses , and the right coronary artery was virtually occluded by a yellow atheromatous plaque 1.5 cm. distal to its origin .
The myocardium of the posterior base of the left ventricle was replaced by gray scar tissue over a 7.5 cm. area .
The valves were normal except for thin yellow plaques on the inferior surface of the mitral leaflets .
Microscopically , sections from the posterior base of the left ventricle of the heart showed several large areas of replacement of muscle by fibrous tissue .
In addition , other sections contained focal areas of recent myocardial necrosis that were infiltrated with neutrophils .
Many of the myocardial fibers were hypertrophied and had large , irregular , basophilic nuclei .
The intima of the larger coronary arteries was thickened by fibrous tissue containing fusiform clefts and mononuclear cells .
The intimal surface of the aorta was covered with confluent , yellow-brown , hard , friable plaques along its entire course , and there was a marked narrowing of the orifices of the large major visceral arteries .
In particular , the orifices of the right renal and celiac arteries were virtually occluded , and both calcified common iliac arteries were completely occluded .
The lungs weighed together 950 gm. .
On the surfaces of both lungs there were emphysematous blebs measuring up to 3 cm. in diameter .
The parenchyma was slightly hyperemic in the apex of the left lung , and there were several firm , gray , fibrocalcific nodules measuring as large as 3 mm. .
Microscopically , there was emphysema , fibrosis , and vascular congestion .
Macrophages laden with brown pigment were seen in some of the alveoli , and the intima of some of the small arteries was thickened by fibrous tissue .
The firm red spleen weighed 410 gm. , and its surface was mottled by discrete , small patches of white material .
The endothelial cells lining the sinusoids were prominent , and many contained large quantities of hemosiderin .
Some of the sinusoids contained large numbers of nucleated red cells , and cells of the granulocytic series were found in small numbers .
There were slight fibrosis and marked arteriolosclerosis .
The liver weighed 2,090 gm. , was brown in color , and the cut surface was mottled by irregular pale areas .
Microscopically , there was hyperemia of the central veins , and there was some atrophy of adjacent parenchyma .
Some liver cord cells contained vacuolated cytoplasm , while others had small amounts of brown hemosiderin pigment .
The gallbladder contained about 40 cc. of green-brown bile and 3 smooth , dark-green calculi measuring up to 1 cm. in diameter .
The mucosa of the stomach was atrophic and irregularly blackened over a 14 cm. area .
The small and large intestines were filled with gas , and the jejunum was dilated to about 2 times its normal circumference .
The small intestine and colon contained approximately 300 cc. of foul-smelling , sanguineous material , and the mucosa throughout was hyperemic and mottled green-brown .
A careful search failed to show occlusion of any of the mesenteric vessels .
Microscopically , the mucosa of the stomach showed extensive cytolysis and contained large numbers of Gram-negative bacterial rods .
The submucosa was focally infiltrated with neutrophils .
The mucosa of the jejunum and ileum showed similar changes , and in some areas the submucosa was edematous and contained considerable numbers of neutrophils .
Some of the small vessels were filled with fibrin thrombi , and there was extensive interstitial hemorrhage .
A section of the colon revealed intense hyperemia and extensive focal ulcerations of the mucosa , associated with much fibrin and many neutrophils .
Cultures taken from the jejunum yielded Monilia albicans , Pseudomonas pyocanea , Aerobacter aerogenes , and Streptococcus anhemolyticus .
The kidneys were pale and weighed right , 110 gm. , and left , 230 gm. .
The surfaces were coarsely and finely granular and punctuated by clear , fluid-filled cysts measuring up to 3 cm. in diameter .
On the surface of the right kidney there were also 2 yellow , firm , friable raised areas measuring up to 2 cm. in diameter .
Microscopically , both kidneys showed many small cortical scars in which there was glomerular and interstitial fibrosis , tubular atrophy , and an infiltration of lymphocytes and plasma cells .
Occasional tubules contained hyaline casts admixed with neutrophils .
Throughout , there were marked arteriolosclerosis and hyalinization of afferent glomerular arterioles .
These changes were more marked in the atrophic right kidney than in the left .
In addition , there were 2 small papillary adenomas in the right kidney .
The bone of the vertebral bodies , ribs , and sternum was soft and was easily compressed .
The marrow of the vertebral bodies was pale and showed areas of fatty replacement .
Microscopically , there were many areas of hypercellularity alternating with areas of hypocellularity .
The cells of the erythroid , myeloid , and megakaryocytic series were normal except for their numbers .
There was no evidence of fibrosis .
The muscles of the extremities , chest wall , neck , and abdominal wall were soft , pale , and atrophic .
Microscopic studies of the gastrocnemius , pectoralis major , transversus abdominis , biceps brachii , and diaphragm showed atrophy as well as varying degrees of injury ranging from swelling and vacuolization to focal necrosis of the muscle fibers .
These changes were most marked in the gastrocnemius and biceps and less evident in the pectoralis , diaphragm , and transversus .
In the gastrocnemius and biceps there were many swollen and homogeneous necrotic fibers such as that shown in Figure 2 .
Such swollen fibers were deeply eosinophilic , contained a few pyknotic nuclei , and showed loss of cross-striations , obliteration of myofibrils , and prominent vacuolization .
The necrosis often involved only a portion of the length of a given fiber , and usually the immediately adjacent fibers were normal .
As shown in Figure 3 , the protoplasm of other fibers was pale , granular , or flocculated and invaded by phagocytes .
Inflammatory cells were strikingly absent .
In association with these changes in the fibers , there were striking alterations in the muscle nuclei .
These were increased both in number and in size , contained prominent nucleoli , and were distributed throughout the fiber ( Figs. 2 - 5 ) .
In contrast to the nuclear changes described above , another change in muscle nuclei was seen , usually occurring in fibers that were somewhat smaller than normal but that showed distinct cross-striations and myofibrillae .
The nuclei of these fibers , as is shown in Figures 3 and 4 , showed remarkable proliferation and were closely approximated , forming a chainlike structure at either the center or the periphery of the fiber .
Individual nuclei were usually oval to round , though occasionally elongated , and frequently small and somewhat pyknotic .
At times , clumps of 10 to 15 closely-packed nuclei were also observed .
Occasionally there were small basophilic fibers that were devoid of myofibrillae and contained many vesicular nuclei with prominent nucleoli ( Fig. 5 ) .
These were thought to represent regenerating fibers .
Trichrome stains failed to show fibrosis in the involved muscles .
In all of the sections examined , the arterioles and small arteries were essentially normal .
Purification of the conjugates
In attempting to improve specificity of staining , the fluorescein-labeled antisera used in both direct and indirect methods were treated in one of several ways : ( 1 ) They were passed through Dowex-2-chloride twice and treated with acetone insoluble powders ( Coons , 1958 ) prepared from mouse liver or from healthy sweet clover stems or crown gall tissue produced by Agrobacterium tumefaciens ( E. F. Smith & Townsend ) on sweet clover stems .
( 2 ) The conjugates as well as the intermediate sera were absorbed for 30 minutes with 20 - 50 mg of proteins extracted from healthy sweet clover stems .
The proteins were extracted with 3 volumes of Af in Af to give a nearly neutral extract and precipitated by 80% saturation with Af .
The precipitate was washed twice with an 80% saturated solution of Af , dissolved in a small quantity of 0.1 M neutral phosphate buffer , dialyzed against cold distilled water till free from ammonium ions , and lyophilized using liquid nitrogen .
( 3 ) In other experiments the indirect conjugate was treated with 3 volumes of ethyl acetate as recommended by Dineen and Ade ( 1957 ) .
( 4 ) The conjugates were passed through a diethylaminoethyl ( DEAE ) cellulose column equilibrated with neutral phosphate buffer ( PBS ) containing Af potassium phosphate and Af .
Preparation of frozen sections
The technique of cutting sections was essentially the same as that described by Coons et al ( 1951 ) .
Root and stem tumors from sweet clover plants infected with WTV were quick-frozen in liquid nitrogen , embedded in ice , and cut at 3 - 6 **ym in a cryostat maintained at -16-degrees to -20-degrees .
The sections were mounted on cold slides smeared with Haupts' adhesive ( Johansen , 1940 ) in earlier experiments , and in later experiments with a different mixture of the same components reported by Schramm and Rottger ( 1959 ) .
The latter adhesive was found to be much more satisfactory .
The sections were then thawed by placing a finger under the slide and dried under a fan for 30 minutes ; ;
until used they were stored for as long as 2 weeks .
Staining technique
indirect method .
The sections were fixed in acetone for 15 minutes and dried at 37-degrees for 30 minutes .
Some of them were then covered with a drop of Af in a moist chamber at 24-degrees for 30 - 40 minutes .
As controls other sections were similarly covered with Aj .
Sections were then washed with PBS for 15 - 30 minutes .
After blotting out most of the saline around the sections , a drop of Af was layered over each of the sections , allowed to react for 30 minutes , and then washed with PBS for 15 - 30 minutes .
After blotting out most of the liquid around the sections , the latter were mounted in buffered glycerine ( 7 parts glycerine to 3 parts of PBS ) .
Direct method .
After drying the sections under the fan , fixing in acetone , and drying at 37-degrees as in the indirect method , the sections were treated with conjugated Af or Af ( undiluted unless mentioned otherwise ) for 5 - 30 minutes .
As controls , other sections were similarly treated with Af or conjugated antiserum to the New York strain of potato yellow-dwarf virus ( Wolcyrz and Black , 1956 ) .
The sections were then washed with PBS for 15 - 30 minutes and mounted in buffered glycerine .
Fluorescence microscopy
Stained or unstained sections were examined under dark field illumination in a Zeiss fluorescence microscope equipped with a mercury vapor lamp ( Osram HBO 200 ) .
The light beam from the lamp was filtered through a half-standard thickness Corning 1840 filter .
In the eyepiece a Wratten 2 B filter was used to filter off residual ultra-violet light .
A red filter , Zeiss barrier filter with the code ( Schott ) designation BG 23 , was also used in the ocular lens assembly as it improved the contrast between specific and nonspecific fluorescence .
Results
specificity of staining
indirect method .
In the first few experiments Af was passed through Dowex-2-chloride twice and absorbed twice with 50 - 100 mg sweet clover tissue powder .
The intermediate sera were also similarly absorbed with tissue powder .
Sections of sweet clover stem and root tumors were treated with 1 : 10 solution of Af for 30 minutes , washed in buffered saline for 15 minutes , stained with Af for 30 minutes , and washed for 15 minutes in Aj .
Such sections showed bright yellow-green specific fluorescence in the cells of the pseudophloem tissue ( Lee and Black , 1955 ) .
This specific fluorescence was readily distinguished from the light green nonspecific fluorescence in consecutive sections stained with 1 : 10 dilution of NS and Af or with Af alone .
Unstained sections mounted in buffered glycerine or sections treated only with NS or Af did not show such green fluorescence .
Sections of crown gall tissue similarly stained with either Af and Af or NS and Af also showed only the light green nonspecific fluorescence .
However , the nonspecific staining by the Af in tumor sections was considered bright enough to be confused with the staining of small amounts of WTV antigen .
Two absorptions of Af with ethyl acetate or two absorptions of Af ( which had been passed through Dowex-2-chloride ) , NS and Af with crown gall tissue powder , or mouse liver powder did not further improve the specificity of staining .
Treatment of all the sera with sweet clover proteins greatly reduced nonspecific fluorescence , especially when the treated conjugate was diluted to 1 : 2 with 0.85% saline .
In all the above procedures , when the intermediate sera were diluted to 1 : 10 or 1 : 100 with 0.85% saline , the specific and nonspecific fluorescence were not appreciably reduced , whereas , a dilution of the intermediate sera to 1 : 500 or diluting the Af to 1 : 5 greatly reduced specific fluorescence .
Rinsing the sections with PBS before layering the intermediate sera did not improve the staining reaction .
In addition to other treatments , treating the sections with normal sheep serum for half an hour before layering Af did not reduce nonspecific staining .
The only treatment by which nonspecific staining could be satisfactorily removed was by passing the conjugate through a DEAE-cellulose column .
When 1 ml of conjugate was passed through a column ( Af ) , the first and second milliliter fractions collected were the most specific and gave no nonspecific staining in some experiments , and very little in others .
In the latter cases an additional treatment of the DEAE-cellulose-treated Af with 50 mg of sweet clover stem tissue powder further improved the specificity .
After these treatments the conjugate did not stain healthy or crown gall sweet clover tissues or stained them a very faint green which was easily distinguishable from the bright yellow-green specific staining .
With this purified conjugate the best staining procedure consisted of treating the sections with 1 : 10 dilution of Af for 30 minutes , washing with PBS for 15 minutes , staining with Af for 30 minutes , and washing with PBS for 15 minutes .
The specificity of staining in WTV tumors with Af and Af but not with NS and Af or with antiserum to potato yellow-dwarf virus and Af , and the absence of such staining in crown gall tumor tissue from sweet-clover , indicate that an antigen of WTV was being stained .
Direct method .
Af was first conjugated with 50 mg of FITC per gram of globulin .
This conjugate was passed twice through Dowex-2-chloride and treated with various tissue powders in the same manner as described for the indirect method .
In all cases a disturbing amount of nonspecific staining was still present although it was still distinguishable from specific fluorescence .
In later experiments , Af and Af were prepared by conjugating 8 mg of FITC per gram of globulin .
These conjugates Af had much less nonspecific staining than the previous conjugate ( with 50 mg FITC per gram of globulin ) while the specific staining was similar in both cases .
Nonspecific staining could be satisfactorily eliminated by passing these conjugates through a DEAE-cellulose column as described for Af .
The best staining procedure with this purified Af consisted of staining with the conjugate for 30 minutes and washing in PBS for 15 minutes .
The specificity of staining with Af was established as follows : Af specifically stained tumor sections but not sections of healthy sweet clover stems or of crown gall tumor tissue from sweet clover .
Sections of tumors incited by WTV were not similarly stained with conjugated normal serum or conjugated antiserum to potato yellow-dwarf virus .
After passing Af through DEAE-cellulose , the titer of antibodies to WTV in the specific fraction was 1 : 4 of the titer before such passage ( precipitin ring tests by R. F. Whitcomb ) ; ;
but mere dilution of the conjugate to 1 : 4 did not satisfactorily remove nonspecific staining .
This indicates that increase in specificity of Af after passing it through DEAE-cellulose was not merely due to dilution .
Specific staining by DEAE-cellulose treated Af and Af , although clearly distinguishable under the microscope from either nonspecific staining or autofluorescence of cells , was not satisfactorily photographed to show such differences in spite of many attempts with black and white and color photography .
This was chiefly because of the bluish white autofluorescence from the cells .
The autofluorescence from the walls of the xylem cells was particularly brilliant .
Distribution of virus antigen
Results of specific staining by the direct and the indirect methods were similar and showed the localization of WTV antigen in certain tissues of tumors .
The virus antigen was concentrated in the pseudophloem tissue .
Frequently a few isolated thick-walled cells or , rarely , groups of such cells in the xylem region , were also specifically stained , but there was no such staining in epidermis , cortex , most xylem cells , ray cells , or pith .
Within the pseudophloem cells the distribution of WTV antigen was irregular in the cytoplasm .
No antigen was detectable in certain dark spherical areas in most cells .
These areas are thought to represent the nuclei .
In some tumor sections small spherical bodies , possibly inclusion bodies ( Littau and Black , 1952 ) stained more intensely than the rest of cytoplasm and probably contained more antigen .
In all cases studied tissues of the stem on which the tumor had developed did not contain detectable amounts of WTV antigen .
Discussion
In both the direct and indirect methods of staining , the conjugates had nonspecifically staining fractions .
In the indirect method , this was evident from the fact that tumor sections were stained light green even when stained with NS and Af or with Af only .
In the direct method , Af , not further treated , stained certain tissues of healthy sweet clover stems nonspecifically and WTV tumor sections were similarly stained by comparable Af .
After Af and Af were passed through Dowex-2-chloride twice and treated twice with healthy sweet clover tissue powder , nonspecific staining was greatly reduced but a disturbing amount of such staining was still present .
Treatment of the conjugates with ethyl acetate , and the conjugates ( which had been passed through Dowex-2-chloride ) with mouse liver powder , sweet clover crown gall tissue powder , or healthy sweet clover proteins did not satisfactorily remove nonspecifically staining substances in the conjugates .
Such treatments of the conjugates have usually been successful in eliminating nonspecific staining in several other systems ( Coons , 1958 ) .
Schramm and Rottger ( 1959 ) did not report any such nonspecific staining of plant tissues with fluorescein isocyanate-labeled antiserum to tobacco mosaic virus .
The reason for the failure of these treatments to eliminate nonspecific staining in the conjugates in our system is not known .
In our work the best procedure for removing substances causing nonspecific staining in order to obtain specific conjugates was to pass the conjugates through a DEAE-cellulose column and in some cases to absorb the first and second milliliter fractions with sweet clover tissue powder .
The specific staining by both direct and indirect methods showed that WTV antigen was concentrated in the pseudophloem tissue and in a few thick-walled cells in the xylem region , but was not detectable in any other tissues of the root and stem tumors .
A study of the distribution of WTV antigen within the pseudophloem cells indicates that it is irregularly distributed in the cytoplasm .
Wound-tumor virus is a leafhopper transmitted virus not easily transmissible by mechanical inoculation ( Black , 1944 ; ;
Brakke et al , 1954 ) .
The concentration and apparent localization of the WTV antigen in pseudophloem tissue of the tumor may indicate that the virus preferentially multiplies in the phloem and may need to be directly placed in this tissue in order to infect plants .
Since emotional reactions in the higher vertebrates depend on individual experience and are aroused in man , in addition , by complex symbols , one would expect that the hypothalamus could be excited from the cortex .
In experiments with topical application of strychnine on the cerebral cortex , the transmission of impulses from the cortex to the hypothalamus was demonstrated .
Moreover , the responsiveness of the hypothalamus to nociceptive stimulation is greatly increased under these conditions .
Even more complex and obviously cortically induced forms of emotional arousal could be elicited in monkey A on seeing monkey B ( but not a rabbit ) in emotional stress .
A previously extinguished conditioned reaction was restored in monkey A and was associated with typical signs of emotional excitement including sympathetic discharges .
It seems to follow that by and large an antagonism exists between the paleo- and the neocortex as far as emotional reactivity is concerned , and that the balance between the two systems determines the emotional responsiveness of the organism .
In addition , the neocortical-hypothalamic relations play a great role in primates , as Mirsky's interesting experiment on the `` communication of affect '' demonstrates .
But even in relatively primitive laboratory animals such as the rat , sex activity closely identified with the hypothalamus and the visceral brain is enhanced by the neocortex .
MacLean stressed correctly the importance of the visceral brain for preservation of the individual and the species , as evidenced by the influence of the limbic brain ( including the hypothalamus ) on emotions related to fight and flight and also on sexual functions .
It should be added that in man neocortical-hypothalamic interrelations probably play a role in the fusion of emotional processes with those underlying perception , memory , imagination , and creativity .
Previous experiences are obviously of great importance for the qualitative and quantitative emotional response .
The visceral brain as well as the neocortex is known to contribute to memory , but this topic is beyond the scope of this paper .

Hypothalamic balance and its significance
After this brief discussion of neo- , paleocortical , and cortico-hypothalamic relations , let us return once more to the problem of hypothalamic balance and its physiological and pathological significance .
Facilitatory processes take place between neocortex and hypothalamus via ascending and descending pathways .
Thus cortico-fugal discharges induced by topical application of strychnine to a minute area in the neocortex summate with spikes present in the hypothalamus and cause increased convulsive discharges .
On the other hand , the temporary reduction in hypothalamic excitability through the injection of a barbiturate into the posterior hypothalamus causes a lessening in frequency and amplitude of cortical strychnine spikes until the hypothalamic excitability is restored .
Apparently , a positive feedback exists between the posterior hypothalamus and the cerebral cortex .
Consequently , if for any reason the hypothalamic excitability falls below the physiological level , the lessened hypothalamic-cortical discharges lead to a diminished state of activity in the cortex with consequent reduction in the cortico-fugal discharges .
Obviously , a vicious cycle develops .
This tendency can be broken either by restoring hypothalamic excitability directly or via cortico-hypothalamic pathways .
It is believed that drug therapy and electroshock involve the former and psychotherapy the latter mechanism .
Before we comment further on these pathological conditions , we should remember that changes in the state of the hypothalamus within physiological limits distinguish sleep from wakefulness .
Thus , a low intensity of hypothalamic-cortical discharges prevails in sleep and a high one during wakefulness , resulting in synchronous EEG potentials in the former and asynchrony in the latter condition .
Moreover , the dominance in parasympathetic action ( with reciprocal inhibition of the sympathetic ) at the hypothalamic level induces , by its peripheral action , the autonomic symptoms of sleep and , by its action on the cortex , a lessening in the reactivity of the sensory and motor apparatus of the somatic nervous system .
With the dominance of the sympathetic division of the hypothalamus , the opposite changes occur .
Since electrical stimulation of the posterior hypothalamus produces the effects of wakefulness while stimulation of the anterior hypothalamus induces sleep , it may be said that the reactivity of the whole organism is altered by a change in the autonomic reactivity of the hypothalamus .
Similar effects can be induced reflexly via the baroreceptor reflexes in man and animals .
Of particular importance is the study of the actions of drugs in this respect .
Although no drugs act exclusively on the hypothalamus or a part of it , there is sufficient specificity to distinguish drugs which shift the hypothalamic balance to the sympathetic side from those which produce a parasympathetic dominance .
The former comprise analeptic and psychoactive drugs , the latter the tranquilizers .
Specific differences exist in the action of different drugs belonging to the same group as , for instance , between reserpine and chlorpromazine .
Important as these differences are , they should not obscure the basic fact that by shifting the hypothalamic balance sufficiently to the parasympathetic side , we produce depressions , whereas a shift in the opposite direction causes excitatory effects and , eventually , maniclike changes .
The emotional states produced by drugs influence the cortical potentials in a characteristic manner ; ;
synchrony prevails in the EEG of the experimental animal after administration of tranquilizers , but asynchrony after application of analeptic and psychoactive drugs .
The shock therapies act likewise on the hypothalamic balance .
Physiological experiments and clinical observations have shown that these procedures influence the hypothalamically controlled hypophyseal secretions and increase sympathetic discharges .
